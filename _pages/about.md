## Who are you?
Born in Puerto Rico but reared in Florida, I spent my youth enjoying the sun and surf of the Gulf Coast; along the way,
I cultivated a love for writing and computer programming. The latter was the focus of my college education and eventually
led me to my dream job as a web developer for [WB Turbine](http://www.turbine.com/), former makers of
[Lord of the Rings Online](http://www.lotro.com/) and [Dungeons & Dragons Online](http://www.ddo.com/) (free to play!).
I am currently employed at [Promoboxx](https://www.promoboxx.com/) hacking away in [Go](https://golang.org/) and
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). I still hack away in [PHP](http://www.php.net/) and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
on side projects, and I have worked with a number of languages over the years. You can peruse my
[resum√©](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/ckh841jdcuj) for a complete outline of my skills and job history.

Writing is another passion of mine and is the reason I keep this blog going. I aim to sharpen my writing skills by musing
on my life and interests such as books, movies, technology, and travel. One of my primary interests is anime; I've been
hooked on anime since I first watched [Speed Racer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Racer) and
[Star Blazers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Blazers#The_Star_Blazers_dub) every morning before school. I still
occasionally write [DVD reviews](https://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/blog/animeondvd_reviews.php) for
[Chris Beveridge's current site](https://www.fandompost.com/), another way of sharpening my skills with the fringe
benefit of watching a lot of anime for free. :) I also maintain the [Lupin III Encyclopedia](http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/),
the premier web site for information on the lanky thief's exploits.

## What do you want?

I want to continue to have the means to enjoy my life; there are many things beyond the computer screen I enjoy: soccer,
scuba diving, traveling, etc. To date, I have been fortunate to be able to pursue my interests with few worries.

## Where are you going?

I am going wherever life takes me; hopefully, it will take me to California before Jm is in orthopedic shoes.
