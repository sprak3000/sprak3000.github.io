![Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny Final Plus](/assets/images/reviews/gundam_seed_destiny_final_plus.jpg){: .align-left}
The TV series ending just wasn't enough for the world of _Seed Destiny_; _Final Plus_ polishes up the final battle and
adds a proper prologue for the series. There is barely any new material in the forty plus minute OVA. You can read my
[review](http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/7127.php) if you wish, but I don't say much more about this
title.  You can sound off in the [AoD forum](http://www.animeondvd.com/forum/showtopic.php?tid/30303/), but I expect
the discussion to be dominated by the usual detractors of the series.
