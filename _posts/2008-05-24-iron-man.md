![Iron Man](/assets/images/reviews/iron_man.jpg){: .align-left}
Finally found a break in the busy month of May to see _Iron Man_; the first super hero tale you tell theatrically is
always the hardest. You need to appeal to the hardcore fans of the character but tell a story that creates new fans. It
must delicately balance the origin of the hero with plenty of action. Most importantly, it must make a film that has
everyone clamoring for a sequel. Director [Jon Favreau](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269463/) took a well written script
and has hit all the marks to do just that.

I've never been much of an [Iron Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_man) devotee; my childhood interest in armored
characters from the Marvel universe was consumed with [Dr. Doom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Doom) and his battles
against the [Fantastic Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four). Walking into this film, I was familiar enough
to know the spirit of the origin story they needed to achieve. Every superhero story starts with a life changing event;
in this case, Tony Stark finds himself a prisoner in Afghanistan, severely injured by the weapons his company has
manufactured. His epiphany in captivity is how empty his life is; his life's work has done nothing but harm the world and
now him.

The next step in a superhero story is building his identity; the bulk of this film dedicates time to Tony Stark building
the famous suit. However, it is so tightly wound into the plot and action that it does not provide a single dull moment.
From the Mark I helping Stark escape to the final suit in the film, Favreau keeps the energy high but ensures that the
necessary character moments and humor are there to make Stark a hero you want to cheer.

Just as [Toby Maguire](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001497/) and [Christian Bale](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/)
have stepped into and owned the roles of Spider-man and Batman, [Robert Downey, Jr.](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/)
has made the role of Tony Stark his; he isn't an actor on the screen playing the part. You genuinely feel that he is
Tony Stark, a man with everything at his fingertips but with nothing other than emptiness that alcohol and women can
never fill. One might surmise that this tale hit bit close to home for Mr. Downey, but he has proven in this film and
others that he is a genuinely gifted actor. I've never cared much for [Gwyneth Paltrow](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000569/)'s
performances, but her appearance in the film is brief and tolerable.

If there is more than one sequel, I certainly hope they bring [Jeff Bridges](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313/) back
for an encore. He played the perfect villain for this film; his subtle portrayal of Obadiah Stane showed Tony Stark just
how evil the world can be and that evil is not just found in the mountain lairs of terrorists. Overall, this was an
entertaining two hours, but I disagree with those that feel it is better than the first two _Spider-man_ films. I came
out of those excited by the thoughts of the next sequel. I didn't come out of _Iron Man_ with the same level of
excitement for a sequel. Perhaps this is due to my fondness for the _Spider-man_ stories though. Would I see _Iron Man 2_?
Yes, Favreau and Downey have proved that they can create an entertaining film around this hero. If you haven't caught it
yet, find a way to see it; this is likely the best action hero film you'll see this year outside of _[The Dark Knight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/)_.
