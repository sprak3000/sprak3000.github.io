_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 13_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-13_article_119682.html)

**In Summary:**
> After the strong character development of the previous episode, the series falls back into its lackluster pattern of leveling up a sword while everyone passively watches. The only highlight is seeing Sesshomaru drop his blank stoic stare and be genuinely angry and frustrated.
