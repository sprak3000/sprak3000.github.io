While my official year anniversary as a reviewer is not for a few months, I thought I would take a look back at 2005 and
recap the year. First, a few stats about what I reviewed (to the best of my memory) in no particular order:

* 2 _Robotech Remastered_ box sets (#6 & #7)
* 6 volumes of _Ghost in the Shell: Stand-Alone Complex_ (#2 - #7) & the _Official Log_
* 5 volumes of _Project ARMS_ (#12 - #16)
* 2 _Inu Yasha_ movies (#2 & #3)
* 11(!) volumes of _Inu Yasha_ TV (#26 - #36)
* _Slayers Book of Spells_
* 4 volumes of _Pokemon Advanced_ (#5 - #7, did I catch them all? Likely not...)
* _Legend of Crystania: Chaos Ring_
* _Ghost in the Shell_ Special Edition
* _Petite Cossette_
* 3 volumes of _Gilgamesh_ (#1 - #3)
* 2 _Gundam Seed_ &quot;movies&quot; (#1 - #2)
* All 3 volumes of _Grenadier_

The past year provided a good mix of continuing series and new series to review; out of all my review titles, every
volume of _GitS: SAC_ had no competition and was my favorite title of the year. If you have not picked it up yet, roll
up those pennies, hit the Right Stuf sales, do whatever you need to do to own it. And pick up the original _Ghost in the
Shell_ movie to compliment it; I have watched this film more times than I can recall over the years, and it still keeps
me captivated as it did the first time.

I was sad to see the long saga of _Project ARMS_ come to a close. This series has surprised me the most with the
consistent level of storytelling it provided. Going into it roughly two years ago, I was prepared to find a mindless
slugfest of super powered teens. Instead, it provided a rich conspiracy that allowed the characters to grow into ones
worth watching. It saddened me as the series went on to see most forum posts about it boiling down to &quot;I'll skip
it until box sets come out&quot;. Well, the series is over, and box sets are looking unlikely now. This is a series
that deserved a larger audience over its lifetime.

The rest of my continuing series was a mixed bag; _Inu Yasha_ will run until the heat death of the universe and continue
to have its ups and downs (Hi, Megs!). I had my fill of _Pokemon_ to last a few lifetimes. But, most of it was
entertaining enough to pass the time.

Of the new material, _Gilgamesh_ is easily going to be my favorite continuing series of 2006. Much like _GitS: SAC_,
the writers know how to build a good mystery and develop the characters into people you not only want to watch but need
to watch. Beyond the visuals, I did not know much about the series before asking Chris if I could take it on.
Fortunately, the series has plenty of substance to go with the style that caught my eye.

_Grenadier_ was picked up purely for eye candy (and a chance to pepper my reviews with double entendres) and turned out
to be a pleasant surprise. Copious fan service was coupled with an amusing cast of characters and a half decent plot.
While I would not watch it often, it is a title that one could pull off the shelf, pop in any episode, and have it put
a smile on your face. Did the pillow case ever come out for it? I doubt it did as no fabric outside the realm of anime
could contain Rushuna's pillows (had to get one last shot in...).

The only other title of note from 2005 would be _Petite Cossette_; the most concise summary I can give this title would
be &quot;acid trip&quot;. However, it is a trip worth taking due to its incredible visuals and _Twilight Zone_-esque
story. Not everyone will be able to get into a title like this, but I would definitely love to see more like this
produced and brought over.

As for my actual reviews, I thought they came out... decent; some I was very happy with, but I still feel the majority
of them lack the polish needed to get my point across. Hopefully, I managed to communicate to some degree the reasons
why I found a title's content appealing or not. Suggestions, comments, etc. are always welcome in the forum threads for
each review or via private channels.

Here's to 2006 and another ten volumes of _Inu Yasha_!
