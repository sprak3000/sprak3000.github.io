![Lupin the Show: Episode 04](/assets/images/lupintheshow.jpg){: .align-left}
Reed Nelson of [LupinTheThird.net](http://www.lupinthethird.net/) invited me to be a guest for the fourth episode of his
Lupin the Show podcast (he hates that term though... don't ask). [Download the fourth episode](http://www.lupinthethird.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=44&Itemid=1)
to hear us discuss the upcoming _Green VS Red_ OVA and more. Like what your heard or want to beg Reed never to have such
guests again? [Let him know your thoughts](http://www.lupinthethird.net/forums/index.php?topic=323) in the official
discussion thread for the show.
