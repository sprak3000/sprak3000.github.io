_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 10_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-10_article_119443.html)

**In Summary:**
> There is little to recommend in this episode; it pads things out for twenty minutes leaving the last ten to setup Naraku's latest plan. The action is mediocre, and the tense character moments are all too familiar. The best thing you can do is skip to the last few minutes; the design for Kanna's mirror demon is rather nice.
