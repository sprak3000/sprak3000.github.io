_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 09_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-09_article_119412.html)

**In Summary:**
> Sesshomaru has been a stoic player with no peeks behind the mask. We have learned little about why he chose to keep Rin with him or why he has grown fond of her. This negates the impact this episode's emotional moment was meant to have. We know Sesshomaru is going to care about Rin at the right time and somehow she will be saved. Even the humor in this episode fell flat. The best one can say is that the pieces and story inch forward towards a conclusion.
