_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 14_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-14_article_119837.html)

**In Summary:**
> While it is enjoyable to see Inu Yasha and the group work together, it is also a stinging reminder that this is done very seldom despite all they have been through. The episode manages to inch the plot forward but fails to provide a decent balance between action and exposition. It would have benefited from trimming a few minutes from the exposition to really let the battle heat up.
