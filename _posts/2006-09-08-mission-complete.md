![New Super Mario Brothers](/assets/images/new_super_mario_brothers.jpg){: .align-left}
After finally securing a completely working DS Lite, I was able to sit down and enjoy the latest Mario incarnation aptly
titled _New Super Mario Brothers_. Having played most of the Mario titles over the years, I was impressed by how much
fun this series continues to be. The gameplay now is pretty much the same as it was back in the 8-bit days.

Run, jump, stomp... that's all there really is to it. But the series keeps itself fresh with the gorgeous graphics, fun
but challenging level designs, and small additions to the power-ups. This time, the mega mushroom and mini mushroom
opened up the level designs even more. Want that last coin for a level? Better grab a mini mushroom and try to run
through it again.

It did not take me too long to run through the game and collect everything; there is a part of me that hates not finding
every little item, secret, what have you in a game. However, the strength of this urge varies depending on how much I
enjoy a particular game.

I'm still trying to collect everything in _Katamari Damacy_ and _We Love Katamari_; no matter how many times I roll
through a level, I still have fun. However, trying to get everything in _Final Fantasy VII_ was swept aside to just get
through that boring mess of a story.

I will always be a completist at heart, but if my heart isn't in it (or my skills too weak), some games will always have
secrets to lord over me. Some day... some day... I will get that pink tail in _Final Fantasy IV_. Some day...
