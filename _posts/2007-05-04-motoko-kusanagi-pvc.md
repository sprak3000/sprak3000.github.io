Ah... spring is finally here in New England, and some authentic sunshine means I can finally get some decent shots of my
figures. Ordered this figure from [Hobby Link Japan](http://www.hlj.com/) when I ordered the [Gunbuster](/blog/2006/12/gunbuster-one-coin-figures)
and [Tachikoma](/blog/2006/12/tachikoma-trading-figures) trading figures. Almost missed out on it because I pre-ordered
a bit late; it was set to ship, but the order went to back ordered then to discontinued. E-mailed HLJ, and they said they
will try to fulfill all pre-orders.

Two days later, I received a shipping notice for the figure. This is a fantastic figure, well sculpted especially in the
face. Kusanagi's mood alters depending on the angle you view her. She can stand upright without the base; getting her
onto the base was a bit of work. The peg holes in her feet were a bit smaller than the actual pegs. Took some careful
working to get them to expand enough to slip her on the pegs. The gun hand doesn't hold the gun tightly, but both of these
are minor niggles in an otherwise sharp figure.
