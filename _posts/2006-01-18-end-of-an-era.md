In front of me stands something many of us never thought we would see... the final set of Urusei Yatsura DVDs, the last
five discs of the long running series. I had to look up in DVD Profiler when I actually purchased the first DVD box set.
That was back in April 2000; prior to that, I had picked up a few of the VHS tapes back in college (circa 1994). I give
AnimEigo massive kudos for sticking with the series through the various formats (VHS, LD, DVD).

The series has consumed two shelves, and I cannot believe that it finally will consume no more. Thank you, AnimEigo for
sticking with this fabulous series!
