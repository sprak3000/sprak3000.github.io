Bright spot in an otherwise drab week... The [Lupin III Encyclopedia](http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/) was mentioned in
the [Episode 78 of the Anime World Order Podcast](http://animeworldorder.blogspot.com/2009/03/anime-world-order-show-78a-look-mr.html).
I'm a shameless self-promoter, but I love it when others do the work for me. You can here the mention about 10 minutes in
but don't skip over their great summary of the three series and some decent discussion about the specials.
