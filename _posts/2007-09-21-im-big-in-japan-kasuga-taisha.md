If you guessed another shrine was the next tour stop, you would be correct!
[Kasuga-taisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasuga-taisha) is famous for its lanterns having over a thousand stone
lanterns lining the path to the shrine.  Bronze lanterns adorn the inside of the temple; basically, if you have the money,
you can donate a lantern to the shrine and receive (hopefully) good fortune in return.  Not much else to see other than
the lanterns, so we didn't spend much time here.
