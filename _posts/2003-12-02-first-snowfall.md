While it was only a brief flurry where I live, this can only mean one thing. The eternal war between man and nature has
entered the bitter, freezing stage. Once again, the shovels must be pulled out and squarely aimed at the frozen mounds
of snow that threaten to consume your hapless vehicle. Last year's winter was brutal enough; I am not looking forward
to this one.

I grew up in Florida; my youth was spent frolicking in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. I came up to the New
England area pursuing knowledge and have been freezing my arse off ever since. But there is something beautiful about a
snow covered field; when there is no biting wind, I can enjoy a large blanket of snow. So, a haiku for the occasion.

Lightly, the first snow<br />
falling to the waiting ground.<br />
Winter awaits me.
