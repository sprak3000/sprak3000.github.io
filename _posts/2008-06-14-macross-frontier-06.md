![Macross Frontier Episode 06](/assets/images/reviews/macross_frontier-06.jpg){: .align-center}
## Spoilers ahead

A large scale attack by the Vajra has the _Galaxy_ struggling for survival, and the President of _Frontier_ has finally
let the general populace in on the dire situation. The entire SMS team has been assembled under &quot;Exception Clause
B&quot;, basically a no retreat, no surrender order. But the fight will not be joined by Valkyries alone; the SMS
possess the _Quarter_, a smaller(?) version of the original SDF-1 _[Macross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDF-1_Macross)_.

While the episode is mostly setup for the next episode's battle, there were some great character moments sprinkled
throughout. Ranka may have tentative approval from her brother to pursue a career in music, but she is still brooding
over Alto and Sheryl's &quot;date&quot; at the mall. Alto does little to help matters by lying to her when she asks if
he was alone at the mall. The fleeting look of pain that flashes across her face spoke volumes about her feelings.

Before heading off to battle, Alto attempts to return Sheryl's earring and manages to get Sheryl to open up her true
feelings a bit. Again, it is the subtle moments that captivate -- a blush here, a shy glance there, all topped off with
just the appropriate amount of dialogue to deepen and complicate relationships. Keeps me wanting more now...
