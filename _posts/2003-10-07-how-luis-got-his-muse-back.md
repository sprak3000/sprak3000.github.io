So... It's been nearly a year since I became gainfully unemployed. I've taken up a temp job; doing data entry for a
health care provider. Dreadfully boring, but it bring in the money. Not quite where I imagined my career being at
thirty, but I have few complaints.

But that is neither here or there and is certainly not why I am starting this journal. I resisted the whole blogging
concept for quite some time; never felt like I had much to say nor would anyone really care to read the ramblings I
would put forth. But, quite simply, I'm bored. Bored, bored, bored.

Somewhere in life, probably around the last year or two of undergrad, I lost my muse. So busy was I in the pursuit of
technical knowledge that I did not show her the proper respect or give her enough time. At some point, she packed up and
left taking even the ice cube trays. I miss her, and I want her back.

So, I begin this journal in hopes of wooing her back to my side. While I enjoy the creation process of computer code, I
want to start writing creatively again. I miss the joy of putting pen to paper (literally and metaphorically) and having
the words tumble free forming a new world before me.

As you can see, I do tend to prattle on a bit. That's pretty much what you can expect from this journal o' mine. I'll
post my thoughts, dreams, poetry... whatever strikes me at the moment. Will anyone care to read? I don't know, but I do
know my soul seeks a strong voice once more.

On a final note, I would like to thank Kinnith for unknowingly being the inspiration that finally got me off my duff to
do this. Kinnith is one of the most erudite men I have had the privilege of calling a friend. His "Mediocre Notes"
(which always surpassed the title) were always refreshing; he is one of the rare people that can speak honestly and
eloquently from his heart. Thank you Kinnith... wherever you are...
