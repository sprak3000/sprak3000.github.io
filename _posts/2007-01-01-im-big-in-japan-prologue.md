It is a brand new year, and I still don't have my on-line travelogue of my Japan trip up yet. It is coming close to the
two year mark since I went, and I'm disappointed in myself for not getting this done in some form yet. I could come up
with plenty of excuses, but they are just that, excuses. So, I'm going to force myself to sit down and do it over the
next two weeks or so. Finally having a starting point glaring at me is motivation enough to finish the job; there will
be pictures galore, a daily breakdown of money spent, tips for those planning to travel, and more.

I'll likely enlist the help of my wife to refresh my memory on things; without her, this dream trip of mine would
probably have never happened. I'll spoil the fun a bit and say that it was the trip I always dreamed of and hope to go
back as soon as financially able. Hope you will enjoy reading as much as I will reminiscing.
