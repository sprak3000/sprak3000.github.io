![Episode 19](/assets/images/reviews/golgo_13-19.jpg){: .align-center}
A man has setup a lucrative trade in human organs for transplants and funnels the profits to a terrorist organization.
Some government calls in Duke to stop the flow of money by stopping the flow of blood in this man and his bodyguard JJ.
The catch this time is the target lives on an island encased in bulletproof glass. The only possible shot would be to
ricochet a bullet off the water of the pool and into the main house. JJ, who just happens to be an Olympic gold medal
shooter, assures everyone in elaborate detail that there is no possible angle to do this, and the magic of computers
back him up on this point.

I think I have hit upon a solution that would make _Golgo 13_ slightly more entertaining to watch. Take a page from the
original episodes of _Urusei Yatsura_ and fill the 30 minute time slot with two, or possibly more, stories. Gone would
be the plodding exposition explaining why the target is impossible and any other [MacGuffins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macguffin)
needed to fill the allotted time. Instead, you have a tight story that introduces the target, briefly explains the
difficulty, and then right to watching Golgo 13 proving them all wrong. Otherwise, you just have episode after episode
like this one; 20 minutes of ponderous setup for about five minutes of interesting content.
