_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 08_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-08_article_119409.html)

**In Summary:**
> Kikyo is finally dead, but this comes far too late in the series to really affect the plot or characters. What should have been an emotional farewell was simply a sigh of relief that we have shed an overused plot point. However, the battle of Naraku was fun to watch and beyond Kikyo's death provided some significant changes to the overall character dynamic. It is worth a watch simply to see how each side manages to think quickly in the midst of the chaos.
