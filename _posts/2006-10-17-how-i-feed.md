I follow various news and entertainment sites via their [RSS feeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss_feed). With the
explosion of blogs, RSS has become important enough to warrant numerous reader applications. Until now, I have been
using the [Sage](http://sage.mozdev.org/) extension for [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com). It is a simple,
lightweight reader that met my news feeding needs.

That is until I gave [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/) a second look. Google Reader still has its quirks, but
it has come a long way since I last checked it out. I've been using it for the past four days and uninstalled Sage as a
result. The interface combines the simplicity of Sage with the ability to now access my feeds anywhere I can find a
Javascript enabled browser.

I'd still recommend Sage in a heartbeat as a great RSS reader, but I can't see myself switching from Google Reader to it
or anything else.
