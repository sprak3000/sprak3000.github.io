[MBTA set to begin passenger ID stops](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/05/22/mbta_set_to_begin_passenger_id_stops)

How far will our civil liberties erode before the majority of people say &quot;enough&quot;? I am all for keeping the
nation safe, but didn't we have an entire Cold War against a system of government that forced people to produce
identity papers just to travel from one point in the nation to the next? Airline ID checks are annoying enough and are
just as ineffective as these train checks will be.

Training officers to identify behavioral patterns are one thing, but random ID stops on rail lines will do nothing to
protect the nation. Alright, I'm done ranting... for now...
