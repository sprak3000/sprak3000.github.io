_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 19_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-19_article_120546.html)

**In Summary:**
> While the humor at the beginning fell flat, the remainder of the episode finally provides material to leave the audience anticipating what comes next. Miroku is close to death from two different sources, and Kohaku's body and soul are falling towards salvation or damnation. Both outcomes are predictable, but this episode provides an interesting story that makes you want to see how it plays out.
