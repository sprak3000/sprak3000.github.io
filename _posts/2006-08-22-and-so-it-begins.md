Behold my new blog... yeah, default templates are never pretty, but it will be improving over time. Basically, I've been
running a [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/users/sprak3000/) for roughly two years now, but I seldom update it.
The LJ interface has never impressed me, but I was not ready to install and administer blog software on my own server.
Until now...

After using a few different systems for work, I've settled on [MoveableType](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/). I
like its interface and feature set, and it has a rich community providing support and plugins. Only drawback is that it
is written mostly in perl, and my l33t perl ninjitsu has fallen by the wayside in favor of PHP. So, I'd have to retrain
the brain to speak perl, but I have found little reason to hack the source yet.

What will be in this blog? Anything I can think of from programming hints I want to keep handy (for me, not necessarily
you two readers out there) to pictures of whatever neat toy I've just purchased. Enough blabber... must begin
customizing...
