_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 16_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-16_article_120054.html)

**In Summary:**
> Kagome was placed in a difficult, no-win situation; rather than having her character grow through ingenuity, we are instead given a convenient power that Kagome has had since birth but apparently forgot about until now. It was a disappointing finish to what was shaping up to be an enjoyable episode. It evens out though by ending with a small but intriguing mystery.
