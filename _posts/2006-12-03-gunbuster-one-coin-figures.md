Picked up a case of these (6000&yen;) as an early Xmas gift to myself from [HobbyLink Japan](http://www.hlj.com/). I've
been wanting these for quite some time, and I'm glad I picked them up finally. [Gunbuster](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=466)
is one of my all-time favorites; had my eye on a Noriko figure on eBay but missed out on picking it up. Doesn't appear
to be selling anymore either. Oh, well; wasn't meant to be.

The various mecha have extra hands if you want to pose them with a specific set of weapons. My only complaint is the lack
of an anchor on the bases for most of the mecha. Would have preferred a small peg for their feet to hold them in place.
But, they seem to be fairly stable when set up. I have a few extra figures left over; if you are interested in picking
them up, let me know before I put them up on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/).

Photos didn't come out too bad, but I'm working on setting something up that will hopefully improve the quality. Will
revisit these pics once I have things down. Meanwhile, enjoy the rest of the pics behind the curtain...
