_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 21_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-21_article_120803.html)

**In Summary:**
> This is it; the final sprint to the end of the series has begun. The final obstacles to overcome are in place, and it is now up to our heroes to overcome them before facing the final trial. Not much actually happens in this episode, but it can be given some leeway as it is setting up the final arc. Let's hope the series goes out with some form of a bang.
