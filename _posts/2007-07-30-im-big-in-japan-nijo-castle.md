Our first full day in Kyoto was mostly planned for us; while the city would be putting on its festival, we would be on
a tour to [Nara Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_Park) and other points of interest in and around the city.  For
breakfast, we decided to stop at Sazuya, a bakery near the hotel; they served a wide variety of breads and baked
goods -- melon breads, breads with bacon intertwined in it, and standards like croissants.  We picked up a small
assortment and some juice for 588&yen;.  It made for a tasty, filling breakfast that was significantly cheaper than our
Tokyo breakfasts.

We had to walk to another hotel to meet up with the tour bus; our tour guide was an older gent who spoke English quite
well.  Our first stop of the tour was [Nijō Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijo_castle), the Kyoto residence of
the [Tokugawa Shogunate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Shogunate).  It was a sizable complex with a set of
beautiful gardens.

While the outer wall and defenses were impressive, the inner defenses were also impressive and clever.  The outer
corridors of the palace were constructed as [nightingale floors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightingale_floors) to
ensure no one could sneak about without being heard.  They had the various rooms setup inside the palace to show what
life was like back then; there were many tapestries and screen paintings I wish I could have photographed.  However,
due to their age and historical significance, photography was forbidden.

Our tour was off to an enjoyable and educational start; our next stop would be Kitano Tenmangu.
