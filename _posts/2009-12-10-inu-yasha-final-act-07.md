_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 07_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-07_article_119374.html)

**In Summary:**
> We receive some decent character development in this episode.  Kagome finally realizes that the shared past between Kikyo and Inu Yasha does not detract from the bonds she has formed with him.  She can finally let go of any resentment to Kikyo.  However, my resentment of the series keeping Kikyo around for this long still lingers.  She has been nothing but a tired plot device, one that should have left the stage so the characters could truly grow.  It will be refreshing to see this thread finally tied up.
