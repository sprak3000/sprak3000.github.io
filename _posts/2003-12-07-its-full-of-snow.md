I spent roughly four hours today shoveling snow. Four hours... Spent this morning digging my wife's car out so she could
go to work tomorrow. Helped another lady next to my wife's spot dig her car out as well. Came inside for awhile to watch
another disc of _Southern Cross_ (review coming soon to an AnimeOnDVD.com near you!). Went back out around 3PM to dig
my car out; helped another person get their car out of their spot.

It was cold and tiring, but it felt good to do some manual labor along with helping out some of the "neighbors" in the
apartment complex. To cap the day off, my wife made a batch of her delicious cookies. Ah... cookies and a new Simpsons;
life isn't all that bad at the moment.
