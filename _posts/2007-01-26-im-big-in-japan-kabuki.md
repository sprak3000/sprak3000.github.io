We were off to experience the traditional theater experience of [Kabuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki) and needed
to be at the Hamamatsucho bus terminal by 5:30PM. While I knew which station on the [Yamanote line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote)
we wanted to get off on, I couldn't quite figure out which direction on the loop would get us there faster. A helpful
(and cute) station attendant politely pointed us in the right direction; thank goodness the Japanese language allows for
questions like "This station?" and still be understood. Bizarro world invaded my brain and made me believe we were
running very late and would miss the tour pick-up. It took a few minutes before Jm got through my thick head that we had
plenty of time to arrive.

Now, I'll let you in on the most important tip no one seems to tell you about riding the trains in Japan. Knowing what
train and direction to go is useful, but there are plenty of people and maps that can help you figure that part out. The
most important thing to determine before setting foot on a train is what exit you want to take once you arrive at the
station. Pick the wrong exit, and you'll find yourself frantically looking at your map and the landscape for your
bearings. Can you guess what happened when we arrived at the stop for Hamamatsucho? Yep, we picked the wrong exit.
Fortunately, we were not far off from the actual terminal and managed to find it by 5:20PM.

We were pleasantly surprised to see the elderly couple from D.C. was on our tour and chatted briefly with them about our
morning excursions. The tour guide wrangled the lot of us up at 5:30, and we headed off to Tokyo Bay for a delicious
[sukiyaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiyaki) dinner. Wish I grabbed a business card for the place so I could
recommend it by name. Neither of us knew exactly what to do with the soft boiled egg served with the meal, and the green
tea ice cream topped things off quite nicely. Jm tried the plum liquor they served and said it was sweet but good.

Dinner was a bit marred by a boorish and rude elderly Frenchman; he and his family seemed a bit confused about what was
going to be served for dinner and complained a bit. It would not have been so bad, but he kept pushing the issue by
making comments he thought would be amusing but just came off as insufferably rude.

After our delicious meal, the bus whisked us back to Ginza and the [Kabuki-za theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki-za).
On the ride to the theater, our guide explained we would be seeing a modern comedy piece, a rarity in Kabuki. He kept
apologizing that we would not be seeing something more traditional. Kabuki performances are an all-day affair with
three or more plays being performed. You could buy a ticket for the whole day or simply for a particular piece. Upon
arrival, we received a small radio receiver that would broadcast [English language commentary](http://www.eg-gm.jp/);
however, plenty of the Japanese attendees were also picking up receivers. Our guide explained that due to the language
style of kabuki and the age of the plays, even the locals need certain references explained to them.

I've always found earpieces to be uncomfortable and had to keep switching ears throughout the play. The play was
*[Togitatsu no Utare](http://web.archive.org/web/20160915111243/http://homepage1.nifty.com/aby/2005/togitatsu-maye.htm)* (*Togitatsu's Revenge*) and spun a tale
about two brothers pursuing their father's murderer. While it did have its comedic moments, I would call it more of a
morality play that explored revenge and the circle of violence it produces. The lead actor was a fourth generation kabuki
actor [Nakamura Kanzaburo XVIII](http://www.kabuki21.com/kanzaburo18.php).  It was an enjoyable evening and made for the
perfect ending to our first full day in Japan. After the performance, the bus whisked us back to our hotel, and we
crashed hard having enjoyed a busy day of sightseeing.
