_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 12_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-12_article_119598.html)

**In Summary:**
> This episode brings much needed life back to the series. Both Sango and Miroku are forced to make a difficult decision with either choice having a significant impact on their life. No magical cure-alls were provided allowing for the story to connect with the audience on a level it has not managed in recent memory.   Astute viewers may catch the twists in the story when hints are dropped, but it is still satisfying to see both characters reach their decision. Here is to hoping the writing of this episode carries on to the end.
