Packed in with the limited edition DVD of the recent _[Green VS Red OVA](https://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/original-video-animation/green-vs-red)_
was a special figure sculpted by [PansonWorks](http://www.pansonworks.com/). Dressed in a black jacket, the preview photos
for the figure had fans drooling over the possibilities it might hold for the OVA itself. Sadly, the black jacket did not
play into the OVA's story; you can [check out my thoughts](/blog/2008/04/lupin-the-third-green-vs-red) on the OVA for
more details.

But, let's talk about the figure itself; clad in a black jacket and pants, this figure completes its wardrobe with an
orange dress shirt and purple tie. The black gives Lupin that signature cat burglar look, but the orange and purple
accents allows Lupin's devil-may-care attitude slip out a bit. What really drew my eye was the sculpt of the face; it's
sharp, clean, and with all the right details that makes the figure look like it stepped out of the television.

I'm not a big fan of the logos they slapped onto the jacket though; the front bears a small bullet and circular Lupin logo
on the left lapel. They are small, but I would have preferred a clean black jacket or a small dab of color in the lapel
like a handkerchief or carnation. The back of the jacket is emblazoned with two smoking Walthers, the circular logo, and
a few other details. Would have preferred this to appear on the figure's base, but you'll likely be displaying this
head-on leaving this image hidden.

As for the base, Lupin's feet each bear two pegs that slot in easily but firmly into the solid black, circular base. The
figure itself comes in two pieces; just push fit Lupin's torso at the waist and stand him up. Close-up, the arms have
noticeable join lines; you can't remove the arms or pose them differently though. Stepping back, the lines look more like
the folds of Lupin's jacket, so this shouldn't be a great distraction.

Overall, this is a nice, sizable PVC figure for one's Lupin collection. It towers over my other figures, but it remains
in the box for now until I can rearrange things and give him a decent spot. Didn't spend much time snapping pics; the meat
of this figure is the face sculpt. Tried to capture that as best I could. Enjoy!
