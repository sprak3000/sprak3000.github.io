Duke's first physical battle of the series pits him against a gun manufacturer's latest advanced models. While the
manufacturer wants to show the superiority of his targeting system, two brothers want to claim the honor of taking down
the world's greatest prey, Golgo 13. As bullets fly across the desert, Duke must move quickly to find a weakness to
exploit.

This was a refreshing change of pace from the previous episode's cerebral games. Having Duke forced to think in the
moment gave the action some great tension. This episode also is a gun lovers delight as it gets into the history and
specs of some of the more modern weapons being produced. Definitely want to see more episodes where Golgo 13 is the
hunted rather than the hunter; still too early to tell, but I suspect this will be my favorite episode of the series.
