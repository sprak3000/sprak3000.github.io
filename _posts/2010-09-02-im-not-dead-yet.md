Time passes, and my postings here have become infrequent. Life... It moves quickly, and I haven't managed to post about
so many things. Have yet to talk about my vacation last year to New Zealand, this year to France, and much more. Reviews
are non-existent these days; I watch things mainly for pleasure these days. Starting to find the ground beneath my feet
though; my goal for the remainder of the year is to clear away many of the &quot;Have to Do&quot; things on my list so
I can get back to a better balance that includes more &quot;Want to Do&quot; things. Progress has been made in that
aspect. I'm getting better; I think I'll go for a walk.
