All I'll say about this past week's _Simpsons_ is "meh".

On a different note, my wife picked up _Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy_ for me as a Valentine's Day gift. After ripping
through the single player mode, I hopped on-line to find... that I really suck at the on-line play of this game. While
the on-line version is pretty cool, I'm not sure I want to invest the time in getting better at on-line play. With the
UT2K4 demo out, I will probably stick to getting my frag on with that franchise.

Other than that, my wife loved her V-Day present... *whew* :D
