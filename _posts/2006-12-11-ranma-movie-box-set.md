![Ranma &frac12; Movie Box Set](/assets/images/reviews/ranma-movie_box_set.jpg){: .align-right}
I've owned _Big Trouble in Nekonron China_, dubbed no less(!), on VHS for a number of years; was interesting to finally
[review](http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/4923.php) it and the second Ranma movie and hear both in the

in the AnimeOnDVD.com forums.
