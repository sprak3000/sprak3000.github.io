_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 17_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-17_article_120166.html)

**In Summary:**
> Sesshomaru fans can rejoice as the episode revolves around his growth of a new arm and as a greater demon. However, the overall story suffers from the introduction of the duality of spirits within the Jewel. The evil spirit will stop at nothing to retain its hold over the Jewel, but the good spirit seems content to sit idly by and be defiled. It is a difficult leap to make this far in the series, but it might be something that was lost in the manga to anime translation. And I am trying to not even think about why Naraku has held off so long enlisting the aid of this spirit. Quite the frustrating episode for the story, but it did manage to provide some decent action.
