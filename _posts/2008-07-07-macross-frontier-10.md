![Macross Frontier Episode 10](/assets/images/reviews/macross_frontier-10.jpg){: .align-center}
## Spoilers ahead

Well... This certainly was a major turning point in the series, one that ties back to _[Macross Zero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macross_Zero)_
as many predicted the series would. When the character list was first posted for _Frontier_, every fan zeroed in on the
name &quot;Sheryl Nome&quot;; what piqued everyone's interest was the name &quot;Nome&quot; was also used for the two
main ingenues in _Zero_. Was _Frontier_ going to bring _Zero_ into the official canon? Yes, yes it is.

This episode revolves around the filming of _Bird Human_, a biography of _Zero_ hero Shin Kudo. Through the clever
machinations of the plot gods, Alto, Ranka, and Sheryl all find themselves on the set. Cue the romantic tension...
Sheryl manages to get Alto's goat numerous times and by extension stir up Ranka's emotions. Ranka soon finds her small
part changed to major co-star role when the director hears her sing. Alto's past as a Kabuki princess ropes him into
being the stunt double for an underwater scene... A scene where he just so happens to have to kiss Ranka. Cue... Wait,
we already cued the romantic tension.

Throw in a life saving appearance by the Red Baron, who finally gets a proper name, and you have one well written
episode that serves as a play within the play. The events of the film begin to closely mirror reality as Ranka can
completely understand her character's, Mao's, feelings of unrequited love. And how well does _Zero_'s now canonical
story fit into _Frontier_?  Quite well I believe. _Zero_ first sent up the idea that the Macross universe might hold
organic machines, something _Frontier_ has taken up in the form of the Vajra. I'll cover the ties a bit more closely
in a digression review of _Zero_.

There is one thing that bothers me about how _Zero_'s story is presented; I would have presumed the events of _Zero_
would have been heavily classified. How has the tale in its entirety become something the common man can see played out
as a film? Does the general populace see it as gross exaggeration making it an effective smoke screen? Whatever the case,
the film marks Ranka's entrance into major stardom. She's now a household name, and her rivalry with Sheryl will only
increase in intensity.

Will _Zero_'s love triangle be played out once again among Ranka, Sheryl, and Alto? Or will our green-haired
reincarnation of Mao carve out a brighter future? I won't find out soon enough. For those interested, you can check out

and _Zero_'s version of events.
