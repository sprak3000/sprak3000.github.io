Finally took a bit of time to conjure up a spiffy looking banner for this blog. The source is a panoramic photo I took
of [Himeji Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himeji_castle) last year. Cropped it to size in Photoshop and then played
with the &quot;Cutout&quot; filter. Text is in the Jenkins 2.0 font. I like it; how about you?
