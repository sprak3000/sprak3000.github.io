Another early Xmas present to myself from [HobbyLink Japan](http://www.hlj.com/) (3600&yen;). Cute little buggers... Got
a full set out of the case including two secret colors &ndash; silver and gold; only had four spare figures I sent off
to someone as their early Xmas present. Of the two secret colors, silver looks the best with the gold looking a bit dull
compared to the other colors.  he arms and legs can be moved about, but there aren't too many positions a Tachikoma can
take.

Photos came out a bit better this time around; still need more practice and a bit better lighting setup. Getting there
though.
