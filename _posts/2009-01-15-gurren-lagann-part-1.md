![Gurren Lagann Part 1](/assets/images/reviews/gurren_lagann_part1.jpg){: .align-right}
Gainax proves they can build a fun and yet compelling giant robot show with the first part of _[Gurren Lagann](http://www.mania.com/gurren-lagann-part-1-also-wlimited-edition_article_87217.html)_.
It has the right blend of comedy, action, and character development; glad I overlooked the endless merchandise around
the buxom heroine and gave this a shot. Let me know what you think in the [Mania forums](http://www.mania.com/aodvb/showthread.php?p=1510324).
