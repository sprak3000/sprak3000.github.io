![Lupin The Box - TV &amp; the Movie -](/assets/images/VPBY-12974.jpg){: .align-right}
I would buy this [lovely limited edition DVD box set](http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=VPBY-12974) from
[Vap](http://www.vap.co.jp/lupin/). All three _Lupin the Third_ TV series (that's 228 episodes for those playing along at
home) are included in the set along with _[Mamo](https://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/theatrical-films/secret-of-mamo)_,
_[Cagliostro](https://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/theatrical-films/castle-of-cagliostro)_, and _[Babylon](https://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/theatrical-films/legend-of-the-gold-of-babylon)_.

But that is not what makes this really attractive; it is using the HD mastered video from the recent Japanese satellite
broadcasts and DD5.1 soundtracks. Throw in a booklet which is likely to be filled with some cool artwork and Otsuka Yasuo
doing the box artwork, and I am drooling over this.

Haven't had a chance to properly translate the announcement, but a statement at the bottom leads me to believe that the
HD/DD5.1 remasters only extend to the TV episodes. Considering the previous, non-remastered TV series DVD box sets alone
totaled up to ~166,000&yen;/1400$US, this is a limitation I can live with. Now if I could only convince Jm that spending
$810 on DVDs is a good bargain...
