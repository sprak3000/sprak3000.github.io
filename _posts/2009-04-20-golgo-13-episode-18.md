![Episode 18](/assets/images/reviews/golgo_13-18.jpg){: .align-center}
After a lengthy hiatus, we're skipping ahead three episodes to see what the latest target Golgo 13 is. An agent charged
with compiling the medical secrets of powerful people has decided to play every side. He is selling secrets to whoever
will pay, and the British government has decided his services should be retired. The catch... they are assigned to
protect him until he arrives in Switzerland. Rather than risk sullying their hands, Duke is tasked with somehow breaking
through the extensive British security and ensure the medical record on this agent reads DOA.

Unless your brain defaults to &quot;no activity&quot; when _Golgo 13_ airs, and at this point I wouldn't blame anyone
for doing so, you will figure out within the first five minutes how Duke is going to accomplish his goal. This leaves
the twist on what the target really is, but that is also telegraphed numerous times during the episode. Skip this one;
you won't miss much at all.
