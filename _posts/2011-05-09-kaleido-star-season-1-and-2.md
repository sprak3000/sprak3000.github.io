_Kaleido Star_ Season 1 Complete Collection [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/kaleido-star-season-1-complete-collection_article_124762.html)

**In Summary:**
> The first season of _Kaleido Star_ is a captivating story about pursuing one's dream. While predictable, it distinguished itself by avoiding most of the stereotypes and clich&eacute;s seen in similar titles. It took a great cast of characters and built them into a close knit family of performers that you simply just had to watch and cheer for. The &quot;Legendary Great Maneuver&quot; final&eacute; provides an amazing yet bittersweet ending that will have you transfixed with anticipation. Funimation gives you one more chance to pick up this modern classic; don't miss it. One of my very favorite and highly recommended titles.

**In Summary:**
> The second season of _Kaleido Star_ equals its initial season and continues weaving a captivating story about pursuing one's dream. Where the first season built the cast into a family, the second season builds Sora into a strong, independent woman who knows what she wants to be on stage. Watching her take this journey is worth every minute. Funimation gives you one more chance to pick up this modern classic; don't miss it. One of my very favorite and highly recommended titles.
