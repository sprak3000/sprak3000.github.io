Our tour was over, and the bus took us to the drop-off spot, the Kyoto Handcraft center.  The center was filled with
scrolls, paintings, ceramics, and other touristy items.  Jm picked up a scroll and a painting (18286&yen;) for herself
and noted some other items as possible gifts for friends and family.  Our records indicate that somewhere along the tour,
we picked up ice cream (600&yen;) and water (200&yen;).  After dropping off our purchases at the hotel, we spent the
remainder of the day just walking around downtown Kyoto browsing various shops along the Teramachi-d≈çri covered arcade.
We weren't very hungry, but we spotted a Mr. Donut and grabbed a couple of donuts for dinner (828&yen;).  Doesn't make
for an exciting narrative to end the day, but it was fun to just unwind and explore the downtown area.
