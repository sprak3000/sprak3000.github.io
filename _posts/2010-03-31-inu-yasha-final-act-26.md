_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 26_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-26_article_121537.html)

**In Summary:**
> The long, arduous saga of Inu Yasha has reached its inevitable conclusion. The Jewel is gone allowing Inu Yasha and Kagome to finally be a happy couple. As endings go, this was fairly anti-climatic -- no large battle, simply a few small wishes. While the destination of the series did not interest me, it is one the fans of the series will thoroughly enjoy. Now, let's never speak of this again.
