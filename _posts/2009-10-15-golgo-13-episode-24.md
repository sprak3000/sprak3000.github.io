![Episode 24](/assets/images/reviews/golgo_13-24.jpg){: .align-center}
An unknown government agency has decided on an interesting plan for dealing with terrorists. They plan to hire
terrorists to take out other terrorists. Somehow, the head of the agency rationalizes that Duke Togo is the worst kind
of terrorist and hires Brigette, a buxom, sultry assassin to do the deed. Her cunning plan goes as well as one would
expect. This was a decent episode, but it was difficult to believe Brigette would expect Golgo to be so unprepared -- a
fatal flaw in an otherwise sound story.
