_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 24_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-24_article_121228.html)

**In Summary:**
> The good news is that this episode brings the entire main cast together for the final battle. The bad news is that this could have been done in five minutes; this is easily an episode you can skip, a shame since the plot should be white hot right now with the audience hanging on every second.
