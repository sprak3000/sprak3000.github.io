I look back at this journal and realize that I have failed utterly in what I wanted to do with it. I wanted to use it
as a tool to write, but I've come to the realization that my muse and I parted ways a long time ago perhaps never to see
each other save for a fleeting moment now and again. But, such is the nature of life.

Currently consuming my time is _Sid Meier's Pirates!_ which Jm gave me as a Valentine's Day gift. I played the original
back in the day, and the update is just as much fun as its predecessor. There is just something fun about sailing around
the Caribbean plundering ships, trading cargo, and trying to romance every single governor's daughter you can find. Hours
have been sucked away in the past three days, hours well spent losing myself to a simple but endlessly entertaining game.

The latest season of _24_ has been great as well; I really hope that this is the last season for it. Best to go
out with a bang rather than a whimper as did _The X-Files_. And the show is starting to repeat itself a bit more
than it has in the past two seasons.

Work has stabilized for now; there was a tenuous period there after Xmas, but things seem to be going well for now.
Fingers crossed.

That's about it for now; just counting the minutes until I can get home and start my latest run to hunt for buried
treasure.
