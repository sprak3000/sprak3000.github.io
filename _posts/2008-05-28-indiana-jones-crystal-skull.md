![Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull](/assets/images/reviews/indy4.jpg){: .align-right}
## Spoilers ahead
It has been nearly twenty years since Indy went on his _[Last Crusade](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097576/)_, and I was
eager to see if the magic of that film could be recaptured after this long hiatus. As the final credits roll to the
familiar theme, I can say that the ride was enjoyable but not one I would be eager to take again. Rumors have been
swirling that the franchise will continue into the next generation with Shia LeBeouf donning the fedora, and it seems
this film was little else than a vehicle for that purpose. All the action was there and was spectacular. It was the sense
of actual adventure that seemed to be missing.

The film opens in the era of the [Red Scare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_scare), and Indy is being held captive by
a band of Russian soldiers led by a seductively evil [Cate Blanchett](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000949/). Their goal is
to find a mysterious box in Area 51; hmm... that's a bit redundant. I can't imagine any box in Area 51 containing
something mundane. This box contains the remains found at the famous Roswell crash, and Indy just happened to be gang
pressed into examining the remains by the Men in Black.

Right, you can guess where the endgame for this film is headed; one does not step into Area 51, mention Roswell, and not
have aliens involved at the end. These aliens though did not lead us to Egypt and the pyramids. Instead, they lead Indy
and his new sidekick Mutt (LeBeouf) down to South America to find a mysterious crystal skull discovered by the Spanish
[conquistador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistador) [Francisco de Orellana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Orellana).
Along the way Indy and Mutt pick up an old colleague that went mad after finding the skull and Indy's old flame Marion
Williams, n&eacute;e Ravenwood. Cue the "big" reveals that Mutt is Indy's son and that Indy left Marion just before they
were to be married.

The action sequences moving the movie forward were well choreographed and entertaining. However, they felt like they were
simply chewing up time; the sense of actually questing for something was missing. Most of the time was spent juggling the
skull between Indy and the Russians. Once we arrive at the titular kingdom, there simply isn't a pressing reason to be
there.

It was an entertaining film, but it goes down as the weakest of the franchise, yes, even weaker than _[Temple of Doom](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087469/)_.
I think this would have gone down a bit better if it came out a decade ago; then, you could at least hope that Harrison
Ford could make one more as the lead and go out with a mighty whip crack.
