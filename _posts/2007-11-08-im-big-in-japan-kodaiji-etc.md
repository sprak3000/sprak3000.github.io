Next on the walking tour was [Kōdai-ji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaiji); you guessed it... another temple.  Didn't
take a lot of photos here; just spent the time walking around the beautiful gardens and looking at the artwork.  Most of
the screens and artwork were historic enough to warrant the &quot;no pictures&quot; warning; at least, that's what my
memory is telling me.

The walking tour continued through [Maruyama Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maruyama_Park), renowned for its huge
cherry tree.  It lived up to its billing; we strolled around and soaked in more scenery.  Sat for a bit to rest up for
the final leg of the walking tour.  Our next stop was [Chion'in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chion-in), yet another
temple.  We were pretty much templed out by that point and just admired the architecture from the outside.  Good fortune
smiled on us again; two geisha were just outside, and I managed to get one to crack a smile when I asked in Japanese if
it was alright to take her picture.

The rest of the tour would have taken us to [Shōren-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dren-in) and [Yasaka-jinja](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasaka-jinja),
even more shrines!  We were too tired and were starting to get a bit hungry; we decided to head back and stop at the Kyoto
Craft Center before grabbing a bite.  I took some pictures of the giant torii gate of Yasaka along the way and left it
at that.
