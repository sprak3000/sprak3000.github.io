When _Macross 7_ tries to give _Moby Dick_ a happy ending, the result is the exact opposite of dynamite. This four part
OVA is a thin two hour tale revolving around Basara singing to space whales and poachers. Inexplicably, they also throw
in a brief lesbian date rape attempt for Mylene. Why? I have no clue; it comes out of left field and does nothing to
advance the plot of the story or build out her character. At one point, Ray pulls out cardboard cutouts of Basara and
Mylene on stage; those cutouts had more depth to them than their flesh and blood counterparts. I think that sums up my
opinion quite nicely.
