_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 23_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-23_article_121106.html)

**In Summary:**
> The overall plot for this episode was predictable as ever, but it is the choices Miroku and Sango are forced to make that salvage it. It is one of the few "adult" decisions the series has fostered upon its protagonists; pity it waited until the very end to write a good, mature story for any of the characters.
