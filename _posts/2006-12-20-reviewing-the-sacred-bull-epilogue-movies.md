![Neon Genesis Evangelion](/assets/images/reviews/evangelion.jpg){: .align-right}
Been a few months since last visiting this topic, but I've finally sat down and watched the _Evangelion_ movies. _Death_
turned out to be a decent recap of the series despite its frantic jumping about the time line. Each main character and
plot point was touched upon and serves its purpose well enough. _Rebirth_ was a good teaser for _End of Evangelion_ but
given the hype around the series probably wasn't needed.

The meat of the movies is _End_'s attempt to flesh out the end of the TV series mythology. It does address some of the
concerns I had with the TV series; explanations are given for the entire development of the Eva series, Human
Instrumentality, and other items. Many mysteries are still left untouched, but there is a semblance of the TV series
having led up to _something_. A gory and still jumbled something, but it is something.

However, all the mythology and symbolism still feels a bit tacked on, a necessity needed to get a point across rather
than something that has a point weaved into it seamlessly. I am still left with a sense that the series recognized this
schism but could not quite resolve it. One resolution I would have enjoyed seeing is a melding of the director's cut
episodes with the content of _End_.

However, I prefer the ending of the TV series to how _End_, well, ended things. The TV series evoked a feeling that
Shinji had a true epiphany, that he finally took a step towards conquering his fear. As the final scene of _End_ rolled
by, I simply wanted to give Shinji two in the hat. I had a clear sense of what the director was trying to say in the TV
series and how he wanted the characters to exit the stage; _End_ left me wondering if the director had forgotten what he
wanted to say and just decided to drop the curtain. It was satisfying to have the mythology tied up (as neatly as
possibly feasible), but the ending for our protagonists left much to be desired.

This certainly was an interesting ride, one I do not regret taking. My opinion of the series has not changed after
viewing the films; I respect Anno's attempts to experiment with the mecha genre, but the results are not what I would
call a complete success. The character study is the heart of the story, but the mythology tends to get in the way. While
the cash cow appears to have [four more moos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuild_of_Evangelion) in it, I'm not sure
there is much left for the series to say, at least to me.
