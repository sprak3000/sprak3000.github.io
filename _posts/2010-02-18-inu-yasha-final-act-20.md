_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 20_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-20_article_120702.html)

**In Summary:**
> This episode managed to do so much of what I have wanted to see the series do from the start. Our heroes worked together as a team to fight Naraku and made intelligent, quick decisions on the battlefield. It was a fight that kept you glued to the screen. However, it still refuses to make the difficult decision and let a major character die. You do not just cheat death with this gimmick; you cheat the audience out of a genuine emotional connection with your characters. Still, the episode did so much right that it outweighs this gripe. This is one of the few episodes of the season worth watching.
