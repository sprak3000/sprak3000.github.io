Heiwa Koen in the city of [Gotenba](http://city.gotemba.shizuoka.jp/indexe.html) was our next stop; unfortunately, there
seems to be no decent resources to link to for this wonderful sprawling park of gardens and shrines.  You'll have to make
do with my words and photos.  The walk up to the main Buddhist shrine was an uphill walk along a paved path bordered by
stone lanterns and a variety of beautiful and colorful flora.  The area around the main shrine was dotted with a variety
of sculptures, ceremonial bells, and such.  [Guardian lion statues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_guardian_lions)
from various countries lined the path up to the Indian style pagoda that housed a large, golden statue of Buddha.
Housed in the temple are various artifacts donated by the [first prime minister of India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru).

Exploring the rest of the park proved to be equally breathtaking; we spent the time just walking around and soaking up
the atmosphere.  I'll let the pictures inside do the 1000 word talking from here.
