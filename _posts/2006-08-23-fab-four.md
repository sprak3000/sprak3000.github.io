DS4 is charged and tested; so far, no dead pixels or sound issues.  I may finally have a winner here.  The Braintree
Best Buy finally had some in stock, and the clerk helping me was nice about the whole situation.  Fingers crossed that
no issues appear after I've played for an extended period of time.  Hinge cracks are not welcome here!  Neither are
Vorlons seeking to pull DS4 back through time just to create a temporal loop.
