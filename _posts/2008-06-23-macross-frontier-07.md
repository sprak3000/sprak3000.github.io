![Macross Frontier Episode 07](/assets/images/reviews/macross_frontier-07.jpg){: .align-center}
## Spoilers ahead

Another major battle against the Vajra puts the _Macross Quarter_ and its crew to the test. When Luca is sucked into a
Vajra capital ship, Alto reckless smashes his way in to save him. There, he encounters what I (and I'm sure others) dub
&quot;The Red Baron&quot;, a red Valkyrie that proves to be faster and more maneuverable than the SMS pilots. Not much
to report on this episode; it's all flash to introduce the new threat and rival for Alto. The wrinkle here is the Baron
seems to know what music is unlike the initial contact with the Zentradi. This was a fun episode that slipped in a nice
plot wrinkle; sit back and enjoy!
