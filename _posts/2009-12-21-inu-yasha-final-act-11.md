_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 11_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-11_article_119565.html)

**In Summary:**
> This episode manages to provide some decent action with the return of some plot elements long forgotten. Remarkably, these elements are used in a manner that is logical and consistent with the story. We close out another character's story, but it is still misses the mark in making it an end that connects with the audience's emotions.
