Thanks to a tip from my brother-in-law, I just picked up [one of these](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000231FSQ/qid=1107915821/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl21/103-9125154-3023839?v=glance&s=toys&n=507846).
Way cool item; just need a few more pieces, and I'll be all set for Halloween.
