![Macross Frontier Episode 09](/assets/images/reviews/macross_frontier-09.jpg){: .align-center}
## Spoilers ahead

_Frontier_ thankfully returns to some form of drama and action after a mediocre turn at slap stick comedy. This episode
aims in (pun intended) on the SMS' super sniper, Mikhail. During a sortie, Alto and Mikhail are arguing fiercely leading
to a nearly fatal mistake on Mikhail's part. Tensions flare, but Alto learns a great deal about why Mikhail has taken
the path of the sniper.

The series introduces another plot wrinkle as it appears Sheryl's manager was electronically peeping in on a high level
strategy meeting about the Vajra. Do I sense a heartbreaking betrayal for Sheryl in the future? I'll go on record and
say &quot;yes&quot;. And the Red Baron appears in front of Ranka yet again; what is his fascination with her? The Baron
appears out in space soon after to prevent the SMS from discovering a Vajra hatching ground. Where he appeared to be
working with the Vajra previously, his mysterious orders from a disembodied voice deepens the mystery.

Was a decent episode all around though it didn't do much to endear me more to Mikhail's character. Did enjoy the new
wrinkles to the plot; not sure how this will play out. I love that feeling. As long as they don't stray too often back
into the slapstick, I'm in this wholeheartedly for the long run.
