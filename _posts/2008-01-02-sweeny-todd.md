Went to see _[Sweeny Todd](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408236/)_ yesterday fully expecting the usual [Tim Burton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000318/)
storytelling and aesthetic. He did not disappoint; the scenery was classic Burton -- dark, moody, and appropriately bleak.
I had no qualms about the film being a musical; _[The Nightmare Before Christmas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107688/)_
showed Burton can weave together a musical narrative. The acting was solid all around even from the newcomers;
[Johnny Depp](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136/) conveys a myriad emotions through a simple gesture or facial expression.
I would not be surprised if he got an Oscar nomination for this role.

I enjoyed the story as I was sitting through it; it is not a terribly elaborate plot. To steal a barber's beautiful wife,
a judge has the barber falsely imprisoned. The barber comes back to London fifteen years later for revenge. The two hours
flew by quickly though after the film I felt it was a bit too quick. Had this growing feeling that the film lacked
substance. Not sure I would want it to run longer, but thinking back on it, there just isn't much there that would get
me to watch it again. Still, was a fun, macabre film to watch once, but it is not something I'll pick up to own when the
DVD hits.
