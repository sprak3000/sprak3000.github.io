![Episode 14](/assets/images/reviews/golgo_13-14.jpg){: .align-center}
When the CIA is discovered to be stockpiling an incurable poison, Golgo 13 is hired to eliminate all evidence the
factory and poison ever existed. The Russian's hire their own professional code-named AX3 to do the same job. When the
two meet, AX3 sees no reason to hinder each other and suggests they team up. If AX3's employers were only so
reasonable...

This episode quickly became my favorite of the series. The story is still a touch predictable, but it manages to do
something new, something fresh with Duke and his mission. It may be tough at first to suspend your disbelief; Duke
poses as a chemist to get close to the poison factory. Now, I'm not sure how anyone could believe he is a chemist in
search of a job; how many chemists do you know that sport tightly packed muscle from head to toe? Or a chemist whose
glare is akin to staring into an endless abyss? This is the one major flaw I have with the story; why not make his cover
a potential buyer for the poison?

Fortunately, he does not have to hold this cover long, and we move right into the two professionals discovering that
someone else is working the same job. We are finally treated to a professional whose common sense overrides his ego; AX3
doesn't know Duke on sight, and he doesn't want to know who this other pro is. He simply sees Duke as another tool to
aid in his mission. Duke never implicitly answers AX3's call to join arms, but you can see the same sentiment in his
demeanor. I won't treat you as a threat until you threaten me.

While they are similar in some respects, the interplay between them shows just how different Duke is from all of
humanity. Duke exhibits no ego, no emotion; his whole existence seems to be dedicated to absorbing every detail of his
current situation and coming up with solutions to get the job done. This was one of the few times that a _Golgo 13_ story
has kept me glued to the screen for its entirety.

They manage to toss in a few other amusing twists; my particular favorite is seeing a woman finally complain about
Duke's lovemaking. Normally, women are gyrating wildly on top of him and then breathlessly praising him as a lover like
no other. This woman complains that he didn't climb on top; Duke may not have cared, but I got a good chuckle out of
this. She also provides one of those head smacking revelations; she also complains that the guy the night before, AX3,
did the same thing. Of course! Duke and other assassins are never on top because it leaves them vulnerable. Sometimes, it
just takes a simple snatch of dialogue to point out the obvious.

I'm not expecting many more of episodes like this, but I hope there are a few more before the season is up. There are
ways to deviate from the standard _Golgo 13_ formula, and this episode proves those deviations can be very entertaining.
Definitely an episode you don't want to miss.
