_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 18_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-18_article_120348.html)

**In Summary:**
> While the plot does not advance, the relationship between Kagome and Inu Yasha finally grows beyond furtive glances and stray thoughts. Both know what their hearts want though they still have yet to give it voice. After so much, it is difficult to be teased yet again, but it was an entertaining, if not predictable, diversion from chasing Naraku.
