![Episode 10](/assets/images/reviews/golgo_13-10.jpg){: .align-center}
Ah... They finally managed to pen an interesting episode. Duke is hired to assassinate mafia boss Bugsy &quot;Big&quot;
Gabole before the FBI can turn him into their star witness. The mission is a success, and Duke gets a good, hard look at
Bugsy's mug. However, a new assignment is presented to him in Hong Kong. Kill the man that setup up the hit on Bugsy.
The client... is none other than Bugsy &quot;Big&quot; Gabole.

This one certainly has a number of twists to it, most you can seem coming. Yet, it manages to stand out as one of the
better episodes; the story and action worked well together and kept me entertained. At least they tried something
different and tried to pen a different sort of story.
