[Pollution costs equal 10% of China's GDP](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-06/06/content_609350.htm)

Anyone know if similar stats for other countries are available? I'm curious to see how other industrial nations stack up.
US$200 billion dollars spent on pollution problems... Imagine what they could do if they had even half of that money back.
