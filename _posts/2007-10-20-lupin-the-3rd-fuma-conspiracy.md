![Lupin the 3rd: The Fuma Conspiracy](/assets/images/reviews/fuma-discotek.jpg){: .align-left}
_Cagliostro_ is the king of Lupin films, but _Fuma Conspiracy_ comes damn close to matching it. Discotek has released
their DVD, and I [find it worth a double-dip](http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/6714.php) if you already
have the AnimEigo version. Sound off in the [AoD forum](http://www.animeondvd.com/forum/showtopic.php?tid/25184/) for
your love of this classic!
