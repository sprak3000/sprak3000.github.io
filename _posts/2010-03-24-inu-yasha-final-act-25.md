_Inu Yasha: The Final Act Episode 25_ [Full Review](http://www.mania.com/inu-yasha-final-act-episode-25_article_121431.html)

**In Summary:**
> This is the next to last episode, and I cannot think of one reason why you would need to watch it. The plot points seem overly contrived, and the episode was outright boring. At best, I can say you get an early glimpse of Miroku without his Wind Tunnel.
