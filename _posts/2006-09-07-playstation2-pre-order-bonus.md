Back when the very [first Lupin the Third PS2 game](https://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/games/sony/playstation-2/lupin-iii-majutsu-ou-no-isan)
was announced in Japan, there was a bonus item for those who pre-ordered the game. It was a set of "Play Dolls" for the
gang -- sort of a cross between Lego/[Kubrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubrick) characters and [super deformed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_deformed)
toys. There have been a few sets of them on eBay recently, and I finally picked one up for myself.

Not crazy about the near lack of packaging material used to ship it to me, especially when the price tag came to $27.98
($14.99 + $12.99 shipping). Box got banged up more than I care for, but the toys are undamaged. I've uploaded pictures of
them into my Gallery2 install; I'm in the process of writing an integration module between MoveableType and Gallery.
However, this will not likely done for quite some time.

I'm still getting the hang of photographing figures and such, so the picture quality varies from good to dung. But, enjoy
them anyway... or not...
