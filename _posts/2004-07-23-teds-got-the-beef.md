["My Beef with Big Media" by Ted Turner](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0407.turner.html)

In some ways, you could call this a case of pot/kettle/black, but this is a well-written article with many valid points.
Best op-ed piece I have read in a long time and particularly relevant considering the current political climate of the
nation.
