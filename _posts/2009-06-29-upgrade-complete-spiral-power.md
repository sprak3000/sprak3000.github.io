Been enjoying my new computer (more on this later) and have used the time on it to upgrade the ol' blogging software.
Aside from gaining the latest fixes, this update adds in proper threaded commenting. Huzzah! No more need for typing
@so-and-so when replying to comments.

I've run through the site and cleaned up some loose ends; still need to check out a few areas, but we should at least
be back to (and better than) what we were before. Let me know if you spot any anomalies, temporal or otherwise.
