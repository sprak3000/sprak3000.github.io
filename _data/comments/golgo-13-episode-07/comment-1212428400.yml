message: "<blockquote>Second, I enjoyed the little moral lesson they managed to slip into the ending. Simpson gets exactly what he paid for, a broken string. However, Kerenski teaches him what it means to be a true professional; he detunes another string and keeps on performing. Where Simpson panicked, Kerenski calmly improvised; if Simpson was a broken man before, this ensures the pieces can never be put together again.</blockquote><p>Personally, I thought he should have learned his lesson, when he shelled out a lot of money to a hitman to shoot a friggin' violin string! I mean, if I had that kind of bread, I could care less about being a has-been. [FYI, Togo's services don't come cheap.]</p>"
