message: "<p>@Daniel</p><p>Yeah, it's a shame they don't try to translate more of the games, but I can understand why they don't take the chance. They probably think the cultural references, etc. wouldn't translate over well enough; I think the game play would stand on its own though.</p><p>As for the anime, I was expecting it to be like Captain N also, but I think it worked better this way. It may still been formulaic and predictable, but the stories would have been even worse if they were set in the Game World. It just worked better having Goemon and his friends try to adjust to the modern, real world rather than having the kids adjust to a fantasy world.</p>"
