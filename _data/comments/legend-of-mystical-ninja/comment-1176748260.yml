message: "<blockquote>I have played a number of Konami's Ganbare Goemon games and was curious to see how well it could transition to an anime series.</blockquote><p>I'm a huge fan of the series. (At least based on the legal copies and roms I was able to get of it...But you can't play part 3 without knowing Japanese, so it'd be great if Konami tried porting these translated to the Wii. Unfortunately, we'll probably just get the SNES and N64 versions, because the series isn't as big here as it is in Japan. *sigh* )</p><blockquote>A young boy named Tsukasa is entangled in these plots when Goemon pops out of his computer monitor.</blockquote><p>When I heard about the anime adaptation, I was hoping it'd be set in the game world, not wind up being like a reverse Captain N. (I.E. the characters visit the &quot;real world&quot;.)</p>"
