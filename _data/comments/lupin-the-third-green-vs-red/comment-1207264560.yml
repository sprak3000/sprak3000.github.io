message: "<p>If you ever get the figure set up, (Assuming you aren't going to keep it in two pieces in the box as a collector's item) could you take a few pictures with a digital camera and upload some higher resolution shots? The black jacket design looks really nice (Nice enough for a fourth television series? I wish.)</p><p>Hopefully someone will eventually translate and make some subtitles for those of us who have trouble with any Japanese beyond &quot;Abayo&quot;, &quot;Taiho da!&quot; and &quot;Mata tsumaranumono wo kitte shimatta&quot;</p>"
