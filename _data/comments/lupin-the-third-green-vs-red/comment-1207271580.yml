message: "<p>@Steampunk-Girl</p><p>Thanks! Glad you liked the review. Other than Jigen and Zenigata, you don't see the rest of the gang much; Goemon and Fujiko hardly do anything. Jigen fans will have plenty to drool over as his few scenes provide some good comedy and action. I like what they did with Zenigata and his relationship with the Tokyo Police Department.</p><p>There were other detectives there that knew who he has and were working with him to an extent. Gave him a bit of depth not seen since his daughter was mentioned in Mamo. Otherwise, the focus was mostly on Yasuo and the myriad Lupins running about.</p>"
