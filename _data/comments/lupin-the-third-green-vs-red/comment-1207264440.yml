message: "Good thing to hear it's entertaining, I'm specially waiting to see the animation. Sad to hear about Goro Naya's voice, I really like him as Zenigata, and I think it would be quite difficult to find another voice that would fit perfectly. Also, I would like to know, what you think of the role of the rest of the gang, you know, how are Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko in this movie? Thanks fo rthe review, I thought your comments were funny ^^"
