message: "<p>Hey man, long time no *see*. I kind of liked this way of reviewing. Really fun! Don't worry, I hate hearing my voice too.</p><p>Firstly, aesthetics: I am so happy that awesome smoking art was what they used for the box -- and woohoo free toy! I think that's probably along the same caliber as the Stylish DX figures. Love that collection so very much. Good quality figure for a fairly decent price.</p><p>Yeah, it's been kind of hard for me to listen to the entire cast for a couple years now. The age is really showing in everyone, but I'll agree Goro Naya is probably the most obvious.</p><p>I'm still really excited to see this OVA. I'll probably break down and order it tomorrow. Also time to keep an eye on YJ! for promo posters. I've been wanting one since the first concept art came out.</p>"
