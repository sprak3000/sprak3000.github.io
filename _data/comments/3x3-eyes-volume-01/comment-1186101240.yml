They even kept the Pioneer logo!</blockquote><p>Yeah, but I wasn't expecting them to overhaul the title when they are simply splitting up the previous box/brick version.</p><blockquote> I disagree that it comes off rushed, since it seems to have just the right pacing until ep. 4.</blockquote><p>By rushed, I mean they hit the ground running and never give the characters a chance to develop beyond the surface they present. Pai arrives; Yakumo &quot;dies&quot;. From there, it's one battle after another without learning much about our heroes or the people they meet.</p><p>Too many spots where you think &quot;Gee, I bet the manga goes into more detail about this person, event, etc.&quot;</p>"
