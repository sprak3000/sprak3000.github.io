message: "<p>Man, they were really lazy on the re-release. They even kept the Pioneer logo!</p><blockquote>Back in the days we old timers call the &quot;Golden Age of Anime&quot;, 3X3 Eyes was a title I was always interested in picking up but never quite had the ramen money to spare for it.</blockquote><p>If you mean the Streamline days, it wouldn't have mattered anyway, since they never finished it. If you mean the Geneon days, that one was overpriced, so I don't blame you.</p><p>Anyway, I loved it when I was younger, but that fourth episode always annoyed me; and it's even worse when I'm older, since it drags on too long. I disagree that it comes off rushed, since it seems to have just the right pacing until ep. 4. But the art hasn't aged well.</p><p>You're lucky that there is a second series, though, since that's only because of the Japanese fanbase; that doesn't always happen.</p><p>Also, if you liked this title, you might want to look into Blue Seed and the first Cat Girl Nuku Nuku OVA. (You might have to E-bay the latter title, though...)</p>"
