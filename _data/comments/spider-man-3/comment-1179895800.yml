I'm not sure how much more depth he needs.</p><blockquote>Venom left the stage as quickly as he appeared;</blockquote><p>My only gripe with Venom is that he was a little too emo( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHqFI1b3ZH8 NSFW) for my tastes.</p><blockquote>The acting from some of the secondary characters, notably Harry's butler, was also poor and distracting.</blockquote><p>The butler admittedly did come off as wedged in, but I thought he helped ease some of the tension.</p>"
