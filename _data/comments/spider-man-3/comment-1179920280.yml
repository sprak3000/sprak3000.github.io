message: "<p>@Daniel</p><blockquote>He's a small-time thug. I'm not sure how much more depth he needs.</blockquote><p>Given the reveal at the beginning and Sandman's monologue at the end, the audience is supposed to be sympathetic to his situation. However, the film does little to make him a sympathetic character beyond the reveal. His character needed something more to make me actually care that he was even in the story.</p><blockquote>The butler admittedly did come off as wedged in, but I thought he helped ease some of the tension.</blockquote><p>If &quot;eased the tension&quot; means &quot;made you cringe from the horrible delivery of every line&quot;, then I couldn't agree with you more. The lines he had were well written, but the delivery of them was one step below someone simply reading them off a cue card. Just painful...</p>"
