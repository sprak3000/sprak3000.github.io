message: "<p>Heh, the pics you chose of Michelle and the first one of Fujiko are identical to two screenshots in the soundtrack's liner notes. Coincidence?</p><p>Also, I was the one who posted a little review of this special's soundtrack to the Yahoo group. If I may ask, was all the music in the style of a Yuji Ohno jazz album, or was there more of an orchestral-type of score to it also?</p>"
