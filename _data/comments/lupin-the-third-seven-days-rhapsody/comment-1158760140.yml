message: "<p>@The Myst</p><p>The &quot;seven days&quot; device really wasn't utilized in the special. They noted the change of days, but it had little bearing on the actual plot. Again, I believe this is due to the time constraint the specials work under. The concepts are there, but they might be too ambitious for the allotted ninety minutes.</p><p>Return the Treasure was one of the unique plots in the past few years. Not only did it have Lupin having to return stolen goods, but it also did not rely on a damsel in distress to propel the story forward. Given a TV series run to develop it more, this concept would have reinvigorated the franchise.</p><p>Lupin and Jigen have never really had it out mainly because there has been no cause for them to do so. The closest they have come would be in Mamo. Jigen is fed up with Lupin's antics and decides to part ways with him. However, something in Jigen's character refuses to let him give up on the lanky lunkhead. It would take a major betrayal on either's part before they would truly be looking for blood.</p><p>Maybe next year's special... ;)</p>"
