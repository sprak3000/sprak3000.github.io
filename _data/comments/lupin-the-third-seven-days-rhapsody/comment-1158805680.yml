message: "<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly. Even considering how long they've been around, I still believe there's a huge supply of untapped potential for these characters. Now and again I see a spark of something interesting in a special and think 'If only they'd expanded more on that idea!'. A new TV series would make me a very happy fan indeed.</p><p>I'm still sad the special wasn't actually '70's Rhapsody' as some sites had mistakenly reported. I had visions of something retro cool dancing in my head. Ooooh, maybe time travel? If we can have evil brains and vampires, why can't we have time travel?</p>"
