message: "<p>@Matt</p><p>Yes, complete coincidence on the Michelle capture. Perhaps I have a second career in designing album artwork for soundtracks. :) The Fujiko one though I believe was used on either the lupin-3rd.net or NTV page. It's all about the cleavage.</p><p>Haven't ordered a copy for myself yet but likely will when the DVD is released. As for the score, I couldn't remember too much about it off the top of my head. It didn't make much of an impression. There was the obligatory jazz club scene complete with animated Ohno cameo. I quickly scanned some scenes; a few had a jazzy feel to them. But, most of it sounds like typical material you could find on any of the past soundtracks.</p>"
