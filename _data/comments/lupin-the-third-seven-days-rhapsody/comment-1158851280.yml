message: "<p>@snowcalico</p><p>Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be about time travel. A '70s based special could be about the adventures of a young Lupin and his pompadour. Lupin's past is the one gimmick they haven't touched on much. It might be odd not to have the usual cast of five missing from the special, but it would be interesting to see if a good story written just for Lupin could be pulled off.</p><p>Though a remake of Time Bandits featuring Lupin might be interesting...</p>"
