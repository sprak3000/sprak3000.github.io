message: "Hey there Luis, nice review on SDR.The last three TV specials have shown that the writers and directors were coming up with good concepts but they just never worked when executed. Operation Return the treasure did have stronger villians because they were fairly well developed but the plot ran out of steam in the third act. Stolen Lupin had thin characters and a plot that went into a few useless twists and added up to nothing interesting. Angels Tatics was crammed with action and had a very weak plot, weak villians,and was highly predicatble. The characters should be first developed then start with a simple plot and develop it along the way to something bigger, exactly what made a special like Tokyo Crisis work so well."
