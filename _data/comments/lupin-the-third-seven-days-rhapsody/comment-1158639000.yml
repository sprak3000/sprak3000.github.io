message: "<p>@Jigen87</p><p>Thanks; Stolen Lupin is another great example of why a new TV series needs to be made. Returning the treasures could have been stretched out to form a decent story arc during a TV run. Sure, the premise may get a bit thin, but it would allow the returns to be more elaborate and provide the opportunity to build the villains better as they try to thwart the attempts.</p><p>I agree that the plot should be simple; it worked for Cagliostro, Fuma, and the other top shelf titles. What seems to be lacking in recent specials is an ultimate goal. Lupin and the gang start off chasing after something, but that something soon becomes irrelevant leaving everyone to stumble around to some sort of conclusion.</p><p>Start with a simple beginning and a concrete ending, and the middle will attend to itself.</p>"
