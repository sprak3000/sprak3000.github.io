message: "<p>I think the fact that there are still unique ideas, such as this special taking place over seven days, left at this point for Lupin is an upside to the special in itself. For a series that's been going in some form or another since 1967, and has a legacy dating 1905, this is nothing short of inspiring.</p><p>That being said, the execution seems to be the problem. While I haven't seen the special, reading your review makes me feel this special had a lot of opportunities it could've picked up upon that, for whatever reason, it didn't.</p><p>I'm not quite the Lupin expert I'd like to be in that I haven't seen as much as I'd like to, but for instance, have Lupin and Jigen ever really had it out? The closest I recall to it was First Contact, and even that was ended abruptly thanks to the circumstances. I think Lupin and Jigen being on opposing sides and really having a go at it that isn't either staged (Lupin III Second Series &quot;The Rose And The Pistol&quot;) or ended by extenuating circumstances (Lupin III Episode 0: First Contact) could be interesting. Obviously, it has to come out with them somehow resolving it without killing each other but I think some such fight, perhaps with one of them mind controlled or something (Stranger things have happened in Lupin's long history), could be interesting. Yet this special fails to capitalize on that.</p><p>I also think that these specials need to move away from the generic &quot;Lupin meets a woman that drags him into something&quot; plot that these specials seem to follow a lot. Like I said, it's amazing they can come up with anything unique at all this point but at least recycle a different set-up once in a while.</p>"
