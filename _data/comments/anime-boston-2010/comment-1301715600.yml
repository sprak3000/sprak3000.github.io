She gave it to me.</p><p>As for overflow for Uematsu's panel, I know they can do it because they typically do it for the AMV broadcast. I'm not sure if it is a technical limitation, budget limitation, or both that prevent them from doing the same for guest of honor panels. They might have had it simulcast over the hotel TV system, but I wouldn't bet on it.</p>"
