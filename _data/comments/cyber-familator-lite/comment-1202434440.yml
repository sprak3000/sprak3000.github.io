message: "<p>@Noah</p><p>Thanks for reading my blog; you would need a 72-60 pin adapter to plug a US NES game into the Familator. Did a quick Google and found a company called Yobo Gameware (http://www.yobogroup.com/) that sells one. I suspect you could pick up a 72-60 adapter from a shop like Radio Shack and have it work, but I don't have any first hand experience to say for sure.</p><p>I did at least see if the NES cartridge would be able to slide into the Familator. It can, but there isn't much room to spare. Shouldn't be an issue though as the adapter would fit within the confines of the NES cart rather than being wider.</p><p>Thanks again for stopping by.</p><p>Cheers.</p>"
