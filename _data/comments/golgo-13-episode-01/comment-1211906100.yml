Once I catch up on Golgo, I'll be blathering on about why.</p><p>As for the other Golgo properties, I've only seen the first movie, and that one was still more style than substance but fun to watch occasionally. I should have realized the the Golgotha reference in the skeleton, but those roses and a skeleton makes my mind leap right to the Dead.</p>"
