message: "<blockquote>As soon as the glass went up on the Don's high rise apartment, I knew how Golgo 13 would win; it was the same setup used in the first anime film decades ago. It maybe fresh to new converts of Duke's exploits, but it made for an uninteresting story for me to sit through.</blockquote><p>The movie's technically based on different stories within the manga series, so I'm guessing the episodes of the show are directly based on those stories.</p>"
