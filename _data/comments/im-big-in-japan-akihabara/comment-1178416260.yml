message: "<p>\"I have no illusions that Jm will be a huge anime fan, but she has moved on to enjoy similar titles like Rose of Versailles.\"</p>If she's into shoujo, I recommend Mars, Backstage Prince[Found it yet?], Aishiteruze Baby, Utena, Absolute Boyfriend, and Nana. Paradise Kiss is short, but it's a \"love it or hate it\" series. I hear Kodocha's fun, too."
