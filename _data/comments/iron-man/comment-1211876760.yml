message: "<blockquote>For me, the Hulk has always been about a man of science forced to repress his basic humanity in order to keep a monster, one of his own creation, at bay. This version was just a jumbled mess of daddy issues combined with an overuse of split screens.</blockquote><p>I thought the split screen thing was kind of nifty, but I can see why you'd get bored with it. It probably would have worked better with Silver Surfer or something.</p><p>The daddy issue thing didn't bother me, either, since I'd get bored if Banner went ballistic every time, say, some driver cut him off or someone spilled coffee on his suit. You need to really feel for the guy. I'm hoping we get Grey Hulk one of these days, though.</p>"
