message: "<p>Darn, I was hoping for Indy 4, but I'll give it a shot. You going to review Speed Racer, too, by any chance? [Assuming you can stay awake through it... ^_-] And yeah, Iron Man wasn't my favorite Marvel hero, either. I was into Box IV from Alpha Flight. http://www.alphaflight.net/character_galleries/jeffries/</p><p>And I normally can't stand Paltrow, and attribute her success to her father, but she was actually attractive in this one, which is the real special effect. Jeff Bridges didn't convince me he was roguish enough[Maybe it's because I keep thinking &quot;The Dude&quot; from The Big Lebowski.], but I agree he did a decent job.</p><p>Anyway, I don't need a sequel to this one, either, but I'm also willing to give it a shot. You never know about Dark Knight, though. If that rumoured 3-hour running time is accurate, and it's really heading into Zodiac territory with its dark material, Iron Man might dominate the year as the rich eccentric superhero blockbuster this time around. I'm still wondering if I want to sit through the Edward Norton vanity project [Oops, I mean Hulk reboot!] to see that Downey cameo.</p><p>BTW, did you stay after the credits for Iron Man?</p>"
