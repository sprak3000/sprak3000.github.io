message: "<p>@Daniel part trois</p><p>I didn't care for Ang Lee's take mainly because it felt more like a vehicle for him to play with some new tech rather than finding the heart of the character. For me, the Hulk has always been about a man of science forced to repress his basic humanity in order to keep a monster, one of his own creation, at bay. This version was just a jumbled mess of daddy issues combined with an overuse of split screens.</p><p>As for the upcoming reboot, haven't seen enough in the trailer to really excite me or drive me away.</p>"
