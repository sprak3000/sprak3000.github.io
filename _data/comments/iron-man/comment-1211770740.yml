message: "<p>@Daniel x2</p><p>Haven't had a chance to see Indy or Speed yet, but I will be posting about them when I do. I didn't need Jeff Bridges to be roguish; I thought he was the perfect subtly evil businessman. He didn't have any grand illusions of world domination; he simply was greedy and quite smart in his own way. He was the perfect foil to open Tony's eyes the rest of the way to the world around him.</p><p>As for DK, even if it is three hours, I have no doubt that Christopher Nolan will make it the worth every minute. The man knows how to tell a story. As for the Hulk, I wish they gave Eric Bana a second chance. It wasn't his fault that film was a giant green turd; I thought he had the right look for Dr. Banner.</p><p>Didn't see the Silver Surfer and haven't made it through much of the first FF film. I like the chemistry created between the actors for Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm (too lazy to look up how to properly spell their real names). That felt spot on from the comics; the rest just left me with that &quot;meh&quot; feeling. Could care less if it continues as a franchise.</p><p>Finally, I did stay after the Iron Man credits; heard enough people at work talking about it, so I already knew what was coming. Fortunately, the news about the upcoming Marvel films leaves me hopeful that a second Iron Man film won't be a case of too many heroes spoiling the broth.</p>"
