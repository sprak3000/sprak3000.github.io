message: "<p>@Daniel</p><p>Lucas' comments recently (damned if I can find it right now) make it sound like this was a bridge film; he said that he could see how the franchise could go on without Ford. Whether or not this revelation hit him after the script was complete, the film still feels like it simply wants to setup the successor and little else.</p><p>As for your comments, I haven't seen LeBeouf enough to get a good read; he's certainly young enough for the part and has a close physical look for Lupin. As for Indy 5, if it happens, it don't see it being a Lucas/Spielberg production again; I can't see either of them getting fired up for another picture where Ford isn't in the lead.</p>"
