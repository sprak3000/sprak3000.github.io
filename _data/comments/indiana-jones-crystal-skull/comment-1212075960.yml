message: "<blockquote>Rumors have been swirling that the franchise will continue into the next generation with Shia LeBeouf donning the fedora, and it seems this film was little else than a vehicle for that purpose.</blockquote><p>As annoyed as I was by the flick, I don't think that was Lucas-berg's intention. It just comes off that way, because of his desperate need to feel like he can still compete with Bay and the Wachowskis. But yeah, having to sit through Indy 4 made me think I actually liked MGS3's take on the idea more, because at least Kojima knows he's getting into parody territory.</p><blockquote>It was an entertaining film, but it goes does as the weakest of the franchise, yes, even weaker than Temple of Doom.</blockquote><p>I agree. People were hyping it as *better* than ToD, but I just didn't *see* it-Shortround and Willie notwithstanding.</p><blockquote>I think this would have gone down a bit better if it came out a decade ago;</blockquote><p>It would have been better if Lucas wasn't such a control freak and let Darabont write, instead of the hack who ruined Mission Impossible.</p><p>Anyway, did my comments @ http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lupinthethird/message/8733 have any substance?</p>"
