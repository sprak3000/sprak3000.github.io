message: "<p>I actually realized recently that the figure is a recolor of an earlier figure (shows you how much time I spend on Yahoo!Japan Auctions). Pretty typical practice with Japanese collectable figures. Kind of a bummer they didn't make a totally new figure for the DVD, but it wasn't one I already had so it's not too big of a deal for me.</p><p>I have to concur on the symbol on the back of the jacket. I don't know why but it bugs me a little.</p><p>Ha, again sorry for replying to such an old entry. Catching up on my blogs after getting settled from moving!</p>"
