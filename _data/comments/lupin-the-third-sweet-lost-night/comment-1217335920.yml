message: "<p>@snow</p><p>The opening is fantastic; they could have easily stopped after it and had a fine TV episode. All it would have taken was the traditional spin ending -- the lamp's value is sentimental only, the genie is real but a hag, something like that.</p><p>The writers need to go back and discover how to tell a story where the mysteries unfold over the run time. Stop chewing up the middle act with narrative and then trying to surprise us with a &quot;twist&quot; at the end.</p>"
