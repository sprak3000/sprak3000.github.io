message: "<p>Darn. They keep teasing me with these fun premises and then nooooot quite using them to their full potential. :/</p><p>I had always thought it'd be neat fodder for a special for Lupin to lose his memory, but more to the point of forgetting who HE was totally. That way the rest of the gang would have to work together (in spite of hilarious bickering and hijinx, of course) and get a chance to shine moreso than they've gotten to lately. But meh, I'm not a writer. What do I know?</p><p>Still, you've made me really look forward to seeing the opening at the very least!</p>"
