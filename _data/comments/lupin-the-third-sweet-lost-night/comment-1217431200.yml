message: "<p>@Jo</p><p>Hey there! I didn't find the animation that bad or jarring; there were a few moments where I thought quality noticeably dipped. However, I think they were simply playing with a few new visual styles, especially with flashbacks. Maybe the studio purchased some new toys and haven't quite figured out how to work them properly yet. :)</p><p>I agree that it wasn't a horrible special; there are just segments that I'll fast forward through when I get the DVD. And I don't think they get their ideas from children small or large. They seem to have simply have lost touch with the notion that a good Lupin story unfold before the viewer rather than being spoon fed to them.</p><p>Thanks for stopping by! Just remember... you may always be one step ahead, but I'm right there nipping at your heels. ;)</p>"
