message: "<p>I have to agree with you about the opening sequence being capable of standing alone, despite my not-so stellar rating of it. This is Joyi by the way - and yes I AM always a step ahead of you haha. You, however, are much better than I at reviews. I simply prefer to just say whether I liked it or not.</p><p>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed with the quality of this special. We were incredibly spoiled by Green vs Red, and just seeing the animation of the special had me cringing. Aside from that, I really don't think this special was THAT bad at all. In comparison to the last few the storyline was honestly A LOT easier to digest.</p><p>To elaborate on your point about the drawn out middle segments - I could easily see this special being condensed into a 30/45 minute segment and still convey everything it did. It got off to a great start and seemed incredibly promising but after we got to the hospital scene.... well you know.</p><p>I'd honestly love to see a new season of Lupin. Then the writers wouldn't have to work so hard to stretch what seems to be the very little material they have. Sometimes I wonder if they get their ideas from small children....</p>"
