message: "'B' is my grade for something that isn't particularly bad but also isn't particularly good. Sky Crawlers is a visually gorgeous film, and its story isn't riddled with plot holes, contrivances, and such. It just didn't get to its point soon enough to do more with it. To its credit, I am now aware and interested in reading the series of novels it comes from. Didn't turn me off of the source material, so that's something."
