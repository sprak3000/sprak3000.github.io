message: "VAP will probably re-release the remasters individually like they did with the dvds for the boxsets. The real question is whether these will be the versions originally released on dvd, or the ones altered by TMS for U.S. audiences. Anyway, I just hope this means they'll bring back Golgo 13, because it's been discontinued. Oh, and if you want to convince her it's a good bargain, just let her know about the pre-order for Legend of Galactic Heroes. ^_-"
