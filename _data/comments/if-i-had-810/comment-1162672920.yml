message: "<blockquote>As for releasing the altered versions in Japan, the probability of that happening is extremely close to zero. It wouldn't make sense on so many levels.</blockquote><p>Well Tomino did screw with the Gundam music, so it's not impossible. Hell, there's at least one show in Japan which doesn't have the original singers on dvd. (Akazukin Cha Cha.)Agree w/ you on the likely release pattern for the show, though. Oh well, at least you got the first import of Cagliostro w/ Shimomoto's sig to boot.</p>"
