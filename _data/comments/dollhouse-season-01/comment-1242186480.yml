message: "<blockquote>Despite the urging of many friends, I have yet to become of one Joss Whedon's many followers; Buffy never interested me much despite the presence of Alyson Hannigan.</blockquote><p>Yeah, she's hotter than Gellar. Anyway, I gotta say that fan-base really stabbed Marsters in the back on DB: E. They're willing to pay money for a theatrical screening of one of those &quot;musical&quot; episodes from the show they probably already own on DVD; they're willing to see Gellar in an MTV-editing-style version of a j-horror movie; and they're willing to pay to see Boreanaz in a Showtime slasher movie; but heaven forbid they support a Razzie contender. I guess they didn't want to stick their necks out for one crappy movie after they did so for Serenity.</p><blockquote>The ads for Firefly never excited me enough to check it out.</blockquote><p>It's legally available on IMDB ATM. I hear it's an &quot;unofficial&quot; remake of Outlaw Star and Bebop. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdt1N2101pU&feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vzuUVR50OI [Oh, and lemme throw in the &quot;Outlaw Serenity&quot; trailer as a bonus. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6T0aVsYor0 ] And since Buffy is a &quot;remake&quot; of Devil Hunter Yohko and Sailor Moon, I'm guessing Dollhouse is a &quot;remake&quot; of Chobits.</p><p>Anyway, judging by your review of Dollhouse, I think you'll appreciate Something Awful's &quot;Letter to Whedon&quot;. http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/dear-joss-whedon.php</p>"
