message: "<blockquote>I was captivated from the start by the intense action and pacing of the battles; some have criticized the use of CG in this series. While I did find it a bit obvious at times, the effects blended well and did not detract from the amazing, fast-paced battle sequences.</blockquote><p>Macross Plus used CG, so I don't see why this one should be any different.</p><blockquote>It has been awhile since a series has excited me this much; the first Macross series remains as one of my all-time favorites, a masterpiece of action and poignant drama. Can Frontier come close to this very high bar? I'm eager to find out.</blockquote><p>As long as it makes up for M7, that's all that matters. ^_-</p>"
