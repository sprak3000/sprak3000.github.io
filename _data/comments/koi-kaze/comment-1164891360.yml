message: "<p>@Daniel</p><p>It earned every point of the score I gave it. Koi Kaze is a well crafted series -- beautiful visuals, great score, and a solid, well-written plot. The plot just happens to deal with a subject that can make people feel &quot;oogy&quot;, but it deals with it in a mature, intellectual manner.</p><p>It's a bit apples to oranges, but it is like watching Schindler's List. Schindler's is a great, expertly crafted film; however, I wouldn't want to sit through it too many times because of the subject matter it deals with.</p><p>Haven't seen Angel Sanctuary, but from what I know about it, I would hazard that people do not have much of an issue with it because of the fantasy element. It is easy to distance yourself from the topic when you throw in angels and demons.</p><p>But Koi Kaze is firmly rooted in reality; Koshiro and Nanoka could be your next door neighbors. No clever outs on this one, no way to brush it off as fantasy. Just uncomfortable reality unfolding on the screen. Still a great series though, and a ballsy move on Geneon's part to bring it over.</p>"
