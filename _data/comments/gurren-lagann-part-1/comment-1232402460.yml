message: "<p>@Daniel</p><p>I don't base my viewing choices on character designs, or any other one factor, alone. Didn't know much about the series going into it other than it had giant robots and a scantily clad heroine. Gave it a shot to see what the buzz was about. As I state in the review, it didn't really hook me until the end of the first set of episodes.</p><p>Until then, it was amusing and entertaining but nothing I'd really look forward to. It is when they turn things on its head that I realized the series gently laid its hooks in me. I just didn't realize it until they pulled them and pulled them hard. Now comes the hard part for the series -- keeping the line taut enough to reel me in completely.</p><p>As for the latest Eva incarnation, I have no plans to pick it up for my own entertainment; I haven't heard much to convince me it is worth the expense. If Chris wants to throw it my way, then I'll check it out. Otherwise, I'll pass.</p><p>I would highly recommend checking out KareKano; thoroughly enjoyed that series from start to finish. One of my favorite &quot;slice of life&quot; series.</p><p>Started watching Nadesico back in the VHS days; never went too far in it but was amused by what I saw. If another collection pops up in the AoD queue, I might finally grab it and check it out.</p>"
