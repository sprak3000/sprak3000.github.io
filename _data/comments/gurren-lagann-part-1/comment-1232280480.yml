message: "<p>I'm looking at the summary review for now. Surprised you were really into this, though, since the chara designs don't grab me enough to check it out yet[Or maybe I'd like the art more if it was actually Gainax's style, and not a style &quot;borrowed&quot; from &quot;Birth&quot;(Aka Planet Busters. http://www.rightstuf.com/cgi-bin/catalogmgr/amrbM67m09tGw3SeQ4/browse/item/63051/4/0/0 http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2662 But then I've also said I liked Eva when it was Akira, Guvyer and Patlabor. Speaking of which, are you going to double-dip on Evangelion Vista 1.0? ^_-]. Plus, I wasn't sure if its appeal wasn't due to the Gainax Geeks over-hyping it again. [I still need to get to Karekano one of these days, though...]</p><blockquote>The result, Gurren Lagann provides plenty of laughs, frenetic action, visual style, and enough bounce for several ounces. Yet, all of the laughs and explosions were a subtle, eight episode prelude lulling you into believing this is a light series. When the dramatic shift to a darker tone comes, you do not feel it was a contrived plot device but rather a brilliant way to make you care about the characters enough to feel their loss. If this turn did not come, I would have found this to be a fun but not overly memorable start to the series.</blockquote><p>If you like that kind of approach, you might wanna consider checking out Nadesico. It's not a bad mecha homage series, but the movie may vary.</p>"
