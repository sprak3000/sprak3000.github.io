message: "I normally don't care for chara designs, either. But for GL, they were already a case of &quot;been there, done that.&quot; It's nice to know it's not another &quot;in-joke&quot; show for them, though. I'll check out Karekano one of these days, I guess. Most likely whenever TRSI has a sale."
