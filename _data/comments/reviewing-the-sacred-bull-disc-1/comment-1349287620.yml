message: "Many people scerifiacd this series, complaining about the difficulty of relating to Shinji, complaining about his whining' or whatever. The fact of the matter is Hideako Anno correctly portrayed a socially isolated young man, who is depressed and confused. He correctly portrayed the emotions and feelings of having a lack of self worth. You can't expect to understand such a persona if you have never suffered in life, really! Such people can never empathise with a character like Shinji. One must also understand Shinji's part in therefore deciding the fate of humanity. He has always been in a hedgehog's dilemma' unable to be close to anyone yet wishes to love them and be loved. Is humanity worth saving? Should the human instrumentality project allow for all humanity to be merged into pure consciousness, negating all such pain? Or should they be redeemed and should pain be accepted? This is the meaning behind Shinji's character. NGE is all about humans being unable to love purely and freely.It also doesn't even begin to touch upon the massive layers of theological symbolism and content, or the expert handling of the other characters in the story. The newer movie' is lighter, and easier to swallow for a more commercial crowd who can't get it'. I love EVA no matter what, but wasn't all too greatly impressed with the fan service' and the two-dimensional Maki character."
