message: "I stopped collecting after volume 9 because I know where this show goes from there. Frankly, this show was a complete disaster. It has so many problems I don't know where to begin. The new series Mobile Suit Gundam 00 looks promising, but then again so did this show before Kira and Lacus came into the picture and stole the spotlight from Shinn and the other new characters. Although Gundam Seed was the first show I became familiar with, Destiny nearly ruined it for me. Lately, I've been focusing more on all the shows and movies that were directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, the man who started the Gundam franchise. Tomino is definitely the superior director and I would strongly recommend any of his shows over this one. The first twelve episodes of Destiny were good, but then Mitsuo Fukuda and Chiaki Morosawa ruined it as I said by bringing Kira and Lacus back in the picture. All in all I give this show two thumbs down."
