message: "<blockquote>The signing was for Terada Kenji, writer for the first three Final Fantasy games...I pulled out my items to get ready and many in line were impressed with the original NES Final Fantasy box I had. Everyone asked the same question; &quot;Is that a real, original NES Final Fantasy?&quot; Yes, yes it is; I scored it off of eBay a long time ago when my current obsession was collecting the NES games that took away copious chunks of my youth...</blockquote><p>By NES, you mean NES, and not Famicom, right? I heard people were importing FF2 and FF3 in the pre-rom days. Either way, you should probably ask for your money back for part 2. ^_-</p><blockquote>Moved on to Iwata-san and handed over the cover to my Japanese copy of Do You Remember Love? to be signed.</blockquote><p>VHS or DVD? There was a U.K. import of the former from Kiseki.</p><blockquote>Decided to check out the ADV Premier panel...They showed off the first episode of a few series, but nothing grabbed my interest as a future purchase...My first stop on Saturday was the Geneon panel...again, Geneon didn't announce anything that really excited me.</blockquote><p>The only recent stuff I've gotten from ADV are Nerima Daikon Bros.-which had more Lupin red jacket references in the new volume-and the Area 88 TV remake. I'm also still waiting for the Hellsing manga to be done, before bothering with Geneon's OVA. I hear Black Lagoon is worth getting. But right now, I'm just settling for Paradise Kiss, mostly because it's more tolerable than the manga. It's not a Geneon/ADV license, but are you gonna check out Death Note?</p><blockquote>After a quick survey, he (foolishly) opened up the panel for questions; everyone was asking him about Bandai Visual's pricing and telling him how it wouldn't fly. Having read enough about this in the forums, I had no desire to sit though this for more than a minute.</blockquote><p>I take it you'd rather keep your Gunbuster than pay for a montage(Team America voice) music-less version, but are you gonna get part 2?</p><blockquote>Iwata confessed that he worked on a hentai title back when he needed money but wouldn't admit which title it was.</blockquote><p>Probably Cream Lemon.</p>"
