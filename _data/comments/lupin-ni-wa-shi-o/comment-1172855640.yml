message: "<p>Heheh. I scrolled down for the picture first. You totally called it.</p><p>The game sounds awesome -- but I was already pretty charmed watching the clips they had on the website. I don't know if I'll actually be able to purchase it anytime soon, but it's certainly something to keep in mind for importing in the future. Even with a lack of knowledge of Japanese, it's hard to resist the temptation of the Lupin-tied-to-Zenigata character. That's quality entertainment right there.</p><p>Thanks for the review!</p>"
