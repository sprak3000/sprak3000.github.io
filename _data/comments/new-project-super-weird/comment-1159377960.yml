message: "<p>@Reed</p><p>I'm both surprised and not surprised that you have this game. Hopefully, translating the manual will yield some clues on the gameplay. I'm guessing from the calendar and the address book that appears only on certain days that you need to find certain people or places to unlock things on that day.</p><p>As for the Lupin touch screen, think of something like Mario Hoops crossed with Dragon's Lair. Tap the screen at the right times and spots to have Lupin duck under sensor beams, jump over traps, reach for a handy gadget, etc.</p><p>Goemon could slash his enemies in various places and in various ways depending on your pen stroke. Jigen could have a sharpshooting portion that tests the reflexes. Fujiko, well, she could seduce guards based on how and where your *ahem* stroking is done.</p><p>A Wii game would also be cool for the same reasons above. Shooting and slashing via the remote, thief like movements...</p>"
