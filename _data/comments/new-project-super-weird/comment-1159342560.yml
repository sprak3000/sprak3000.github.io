message: "<p>I have that game too, actually. Seems moderately difficult to grasp in full (i.e., unlocking the extra features). I have a few of the graphic novel covers unlocked and viewable, but that's all I've got so far. I got a bit frustrated with unlocking further and gave up.</p><p>Great artwork though. Found it interesting that it follows the manga style and largely ignores the anime outside of keeping Lum's VA.</p><p>I would hope either DS or Wii see a Lupin game; I could see &quot;Lupin the Shooting&quot; coming to Wii without much difficulty, at the very least. I came up with the obvious lock-picking function for a DS title, but I'm a bit stumped for others. Maybe plotting one's path through blueprints by pen? Bah, it's 1:30am.</p><p>I could also see a text-adventure game for DS (see: the PSX Cagliostro or the GameCube game) but I really hope they have something more action-oriented; Japanese text isn't English enough for me.</p>"
