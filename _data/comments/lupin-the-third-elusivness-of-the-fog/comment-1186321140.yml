message: "<p>Time travel? YES. Clearly someone listened to my wish in your review of last year's special. ;)</p><p>Seriously though, it's a shame to hear they didn't use the full potential of the concept... but I can't especially say I'm surprised considering how the specials have been the past couple years. I have a bit of a soft spot for the idea of sci-fi plots in Lupin features, and they're just not excecuted that often. At least this is a slight change in what the formula has been, and hey there's always next year. (How many fandoms have the luxury of saying THAT? Still, a new TV series *would* be nice. What can I say, I'm greedy.)</p>"
