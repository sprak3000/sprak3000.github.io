message: "Elfen Lied looks like some weird hybrid between Evangelion and Mermaid's Scar. I'm guessing it got overhyped, because like Gantz, it tries to use a pseudo-analytical &quot;approach&quot;(i.e. slow camera pans and zooms and random introspective questions and whatever else appeals to the Hard Candy/Saw crowd) to its violence. Why don't they make gorefests like Hokuto No Ken anymore? (Well ok, they did with the recent movies, but still...) Even the latest update of Guyver is desperately trying to be &quot;deep&quot;(read: emo). I guess I'll blame it on Kite. Anyway, I take it you won't be holding out for the OVA? ^_-"
