message: "<p>You gonna get the Emma anime? I guess if you're into that series, you could torture yourself with(I mean try) Mahoromatic...I've read some of the Emma manga, and didn't like how it went into a creepy dramatic flashback, when it was fine where it was going, but I'll probably still stick with it. You could also go Victorian with Steamboy, but that's more like a bad Michael Bay movie. (I know, I know... &quot;Are there any other kind?&quot;)</p><p>If &quot;Jm&quot; doesn't mind being annoyed, she could also check out the &quot;Godchild&quot; and &quot;Cain Saga&quot; manga. It's basically like Sweeney Todd, if the characters were as self-righteous and antipathetic as the ones in Evangelion. Oh, and I'm fond of Mushishi, but you have to have a lot of patience when sitting through it.</p><p>Anyway, any chance you'll try to make A-Kon for Nabeshin?</p>"
